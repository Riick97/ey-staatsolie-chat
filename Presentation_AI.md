# AI-Powered Enterprise Search and Chatbot System

## üìã (Foundation/Structure)
### Traditional System
- Traditional keyword-based search system
  - No knowledge base
  - Limited FAQ-based chatbot responses
  - No intelligence layer 

### New system - Enhanced System Architecture
1. Knowledge Base (Neo4j)
   - Conext storage in the data
   - Relationship mapping

2. Intelligence Layer (GPT-4)
   - Natural language processing
   - Content summarize
     - not precicely what is in a faw list
       - Can generate a Response 

3. Orchestration Layer (LangChain)
   - Content retrieval from you knowledge base
   - goes to you AI llanguage model
   - Response management
and enhancement

## üß† (Processing/Reasoning)
### Problem Of old chatbot systems
- Traditional limitations:
