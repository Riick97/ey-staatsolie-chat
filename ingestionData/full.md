2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**I am proud to report that 2024 was a landmark year for
our company and our country. A new era was ushered
in on 30 September when we approved the development
plan for the GranMorgu oil field in Block 58 offshore
Suriname, and TotalEnergies announced their Final
Investment Decision (FID) for the project on 1 October.**

The project name GranMorgu was inspired by the majestic
Goliath Grouper, locally known as the GranMorgu, which
inhabits the coastal waters of Suriname. In a beautiful
synchronicity, the words gran morgu also carries the meaning
of ‘a grand morning’ in Surinamese, signifying a new dawn
and the promise of new beginnings. With these milestones,
we are embarking on a new phase of transformational
growth, which is being built on nearly 45 years of consistent
excellence across our Upstream and Downstream
operations, putting Staatsolie in a well-prepared position to
participate in offshore energy projects. Fiscal year 2024 was
no exception to this trend, providing another year of solid
financial and operational results.

```
Financial Results
Consolidated revenue for 2024 reached US$ 735 million
(US$ 722 million in 2023). Pre-tax profit was US$ 430 million
(US$ 426 million in 2023). Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were approximately
US$ 604 million (US$ 632 million in 2023).
```
```
Our contribution to the Government of Suriname (GoS)
amounted to US$ 384 million (US$ 335 million in 2023) in
the form of taxes, dividends, and royalties from Staatsolie’s
participation in gold mines. Once again, Staatsolie had
a significant impact on Suriname’s economy, as our
contribution to GoS was approximately nine percent of the
total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and representing about
31 percent of total government revenue in 2024.
```
## Message of the Managing Director

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


```
Operational Results
Our Zero Harm core value underpins our commitment to
continuously strive for a zero-incident work culture. In 2024,
we achieved a significant improvement in our workforce total
recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR). Our workforce
TRIFR decreased to 0.61 from 2.52 in 2023, which brings us
on par with the industry average of 0.70.
```
```
In 2024, we produced 6.41 million barrels of Saramacca
Crude from our onshore oil fields, compared to 6.27 million in
```
2023. The production increase in our very mature fields is the
result of recent improvement projects, including good results
from our improved - and enhanced oil recovery (IOR and
EOR) projects.

```
In our refinery we produced 2.9 million barrels of high-quality
diesel and gasoline, compared to 3.16 million in 2023.
This year’s production targets were adjusted to accommodate
downtime from our refinery’s quadrennial maintenance
turnaround, which was successfully completed in early
```
2024. This involved 385,000 hours with only one recordable
incident (restricted work case) and zero loss time injuries.
Several improvement projects were carried out, contributing
to more efficient refinery operations.

```
Staatsolie’s subsidiary, Staatsolie Power Company Suriname
N.V. (SPCS), generated approximately 1.41 million megawatt
hours (MWh) of electricity, accounting for 67 percent of
Suriname’s electricity demand. Approximately 42 percent of
the national electricity demand was supplied from the SPCS
Brokopondo hydropower plant.
```
```
In retail operations, our subsidiary GOw2 maintained
a market share of 57 percent and continued expanding
its retail network by opening a new dealer-owned and
operated station.
```
```
Offshore Advances
With the FID from TotalEnergies and partner APA
Corporation highlighted above, Suriname’s first Offshore oil
field development is officially underway. Contracts for major
production facilities have been signed, securing a significant
portion of the capital investment. The construction of the
Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit has
commenced. In the coming years, production and injection
wells will be drilled, subsea installations and pipelines will be
laid, and modules will be installed on the FPSO.
The operational activities for drilling the wells, in particular,
will be conducted from Suriname, generating a significant
positive spin-off for the Surinamese economy through the
employment of local labor and the local procurement of
goods and services. Over the past year, Staatsolie has
continued to inform Surinamese businesses and other
stakeholders about the upcoming local content opportunities.
First oil from the GranMorgu field is expected in 2028. As of
March 2025 overall progress of the project is twelve percent.
```
- In March, a Letter of Agreement (LoA) was signed with
    PETRONAS facilitating further exploration of the gas
    discovery made in 2020 at the Sloanea-1 exploration well
    in Block 52. Such an agreement is prescribed for non-
    associated gas by the production sharing agreement of
    each block. The LoA with PETRONAS outlines the key
    terms and conditions for exploring the commercial viability
    of developing a gas field in Block 52. As a result, the
    Sloanea-2 well was drilled in the second quarter of 2024 to
    evaluate and appraise the Sloanea-1 gas discovery.
- Based on the results, including the first gas production
    test in Surinamese waters, PETRONAS has initiated pre-
    development activities with the possibility of an FID as
    early as 2026.

**8**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


- On 15 May PETRONAS confirmed a discovery at the
    Fusaea-1 exploration well in Block 52. This new discovery
    is being further evaluated to determine the size of the
    reservoir. Additionally, studies will be conducted to
    assess the feasibility of jointly developing the Fusaea-
    discovery with the earlier Roystonea-1 discovery and
    further exploration. Two exploration wells are planned to
    be drilled in 2025.
- On 13 September, Staatsolie and PetroChina Investment
    Suriname B.V. (PetroChina), a subsidiary of China National
    Petroleum Corporation, signed production sharing
    contracts (PSCs) for offshore blocks 14 and 15. With
    these contracts, PetroChina has obtained the exploration,
    development, and production rights in both blocks.
    Staatsolie, through its subsidiary Paradise Oil Company
    N.V. (POC), holds a thirty percent participating interest.

**ESG Commitment**
We remain committed to continuously strengthening our
focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
initiatives. Key areas include reducing carbon emissions,
supporting social programs—particularly in healthcare,
education, and for the elderly and disabled—and
strengthening our Corporate Governance Code.

Our Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
(EMMP) guides us in implementing measures to address
the environmental and socio-economic impacts of our
operations. Operating in accordance with the ISO-14001-
certified environmental management system, we conduct
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) on
any project we undertake and monitor environmental impact
from our existing operations.

```
In 2024, Staatsolie and the Staatsolie Foundation for
Community Development invested approximately US$ 3
million in social initiatives. We amplified our social impact by
engaging in projects with our gold mining partners Newmont
and Rosebel Gold Mines, and by supporting initiatives
spearheaded by our International Oil Company (IOC) partners.
```
```
Staatsolie has implemented a strong and effective
governance structure throughout the company, along with
high standards and clear controls and a disciplined approach
to risk management. In 2024, we focused on further
enhancing the compliance structure with regards to laws and
regulations, policies, and procedures.
```
```
Our 2023 Sustainability Report was published in 2024 and is
available on the Staatsolie website.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Looking Ahead**
A key focus going forward will be funding our participation
in the GranMorgu project and potential future Offshore
developments. Staatsolie can participate up to twenty percent
in the GranMorgu project, becoming a strategic partner in
this milestone offshore development. This would require
Staatsolie to contribute US$ 2.4 billion in the estimated
development costs of US$ 12.2 billion. A portion of this
amount was raised through a new bond issue in March 2025.
Additional financing will come from loans and/or partnerships,
and our already secured internal contribution. We believe the
GranMorgu is just the beginning and remain committed to
promoting the full potential of our offshore acreage.

Our efforts regarding sustainable energy will continue
in 2025. We are awaiting approval from the GoS and
governmental institutes for our 30 megawatt-peak (MWp)
solar project. Our hydro turbine upgrading project is
progressing well and will be completed in 2028 increasing
power generation with a minimum of five percent with the
same amount of water inflow. The first of three turbines to
be upgraded will be commissioned in 2025. We presented
our decarbonization ambitions in our 2023 sustainability
report with specific targets for 2030 that include measuring,
reporting, and reduction goals.

**Governance Focus**
Preparing for the significant impact of future offshore oil and
gas production on the country, will be another key focus
in the years ahead. For Suriname, potential hydrocarbon
profits represent both a tremendous opportunity and a
profound responsibility. The sources and uses of funds are
disclosed in Staatsolie’s annual reports and are also reported
to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
TotalEnergies, the Operator of the GranMorgu project,
will also report all transfers to Staatsolie and the Government

```
of Suriname to the EITI. We encourage other stakeholders to
do the same in view of accounting for the funds.
```
```
Staatsolie is fully committed to supporting a solid Sovereign
Wealth and Stabilization Fund (SWSF). We contributed to
the intense discussions on this law, which was approved by
Parliament on 31 December 2024. Although the law has been
approved, several key operational measures still need to be
implemented.
```
```
The significant challenges associated with these types of
developments, which are well documented globally, will
require the Government to implement diligent policies to
mitigate their effects. Notable effects include high demand
for goods and services, invoking a ‘pull’ effect on inflation
in sectors such as housing and food supply as well as the
crowding out of other sectors of the economy due to shifts in
employment and activities.
```
```
Drawing upon our core principle of “Confidence in our own
abilities”, Staatsolie has laid a solid foundation to achieve its
vision of “Energizing a bright future for Suriname”. This was
possible with the support of all our stakeholders, including
the Government of Suriname, our Supervisory Board,
employees, partners, service providers, customers and the
citizens of Suriname. Your support has been instrumental in
our achievements in 2024, for which we are very grateful.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Supervisory Activities**
The Supervisory Board is independent, professional and
supportive. Supervision focuses primarily on achieving
financial and operational objectives, compliance and
governance. In line with this, the Supervisory Board ensures
that business risks are adequately identified and managed by
the company, that the culture and behavior are appropriate
and that business operations are lean, efficient and
transparent.

In addition to regular activities, supervision during the fiscal
year 2024 focused primarily on advising and supporting the
BoED in adjusting the organizational structure, preparing for
participation in the first offshore development and further
strengthening corporate governance.

Staatsolie is experiencing significant developments and
defined a new strategy in 2022. Due to the new strategy,
it was necessary to evaluate the organizational structure.
This process was initiated in March 2023 with the help of
external experts.

```
In connection with the renewed strategy and the implications
for the top structure, the company’s management model was
also evaluated. This process was completed in 2024 and a
soft launch of the adjusted organizational structure took place
in December 2024.
```
```
Due to international developments in the field of corporate
governance, the Supervisory Board has redefined the
Supervisory Board Charter. During fiscal year 2024, the
enhanced regulation was discussed with the BoED and
implementation will take place in 2025.
```
```
The Supervisory Board meets according to a predetermined
meeting schedule and activity calendar, and as often as
deemed necessary. The Supervisory Board also meets
regularly with the BoED. There is also periodic consultation
with the shareholder.
```
```
In the fiscal year 2024, the Supervisory Board had 44 regular
meetings, of which eleven meetings with the BoED and four
meetings with the shareholder. Three company visits were
made to Staatsolie business locations.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Supervisory Board Committees**
Based on the Supervisory Board regulations, the Supervisory
Board has three committees with specific subtasks to
support supervision: Remuneration Committee (RC), Audit
Committee (AC) and the Risk & Compliance Committee.
Below is a summary report of the activities of each committee
during fiscal year 2024.

```
Audit Committee
In 2024 the Audit Committee (AC) consisted of J. Bousaid
(chair), B. Dwarkasing and L. Jack. The duties and
responsibilities of the committee are laid down in the Audit
Committee Charter and include among others advising
the Supervisory Board on issues of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), financial risk management and
controls, and the audits executed by the internal and external
auditors.
During the fiscal year 2024, the AC had several meetings with
the BoED, the internal audit division, and the external auditor
regarding the audit of the 2023 financial statements and the
Management Letter, the audit plan 2024 and the institutional
capacity of the audit division, the periodic review of the audit
charter, and several other financial-economic issues.
```
```
In 2023, an important project aiming at improving the
financial controls within Staatsolie started with the support
of specialized international experts of Price Waterhouse
Coopers (PWC). In the fiscal year 2024, the AC had several
meetings with the consultancy group and management and
gave recommendations to improve the financial controls.
```
```
The supervisory board strongly supports this project and
requested all involved parties to accelerate their efforts to
make this project, which will continue throughout 2025,
a great success.
```
```
During fiscal year 2024, an experienced consultant
conducted an independent review of the quality of the internal
audit organization at Staatsolie. At year end he presented his
report with several valuable recommendations which will be
implemented.
```
```
Risk & Compliance Committee
In 2024, the Risk & Compliance Committee (RCC) consisted
of D. Caffé (chair), L. Jack (vice chair), B. Dwarkasing,
M. Srihar Doobe, J. Bousaid, and S. Betterson.
In 2024, the RCC had meetings with the Risk & Compliance
team of Staatsolie and internal meetings, during which
the further development of the company’s non-financial
risk strategy was discussed. Staatsolie compiled a Risk
Report for 2024, which was sent to the Supervisory Board
for discussion. Furthermore, the method of reporting
Governance & Compliance indicators was further developed.
The progress of the implementation of Enterprise Risk
Assessment - Final Report dated 19 April 2022 was
discussed and followed up arrangements were made on the
periodic reporting and implementation. During the meetings,
several important topics were discussed, such as the Risk
Appetite Statement and Compliance Registers. Business
Continuity Management (BCM) and Enterprise Risks were
discussed as well. The compliance report was discussed with
management.
```
```

the facilitator or an expert. Where necessary, agreements
are made about the performance and development of the
members and the Supervisory Board.

During fiscal year 2024, the Supervisory Board evaluated
its own performance and that of the individual members,
whereby, in accordance with the provisions of the
Supervisory Board regulations, permanent education was
also discussed.

During fiscal year 2024, each member of the Supervisory
Board exercised independent supervision. None of them
reported transactions or decisions with conflicting interests.
There is also no business relationship between members
of the Supervisory Board and Staatsolie Maatschappij N.V.,
from which personal benefit could be gained. No financial
benefits have been provided to members that do not fall
under the remuneration policy.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**The macroeconomic environment in 2024 faced
several significant challenges. One of the most
pressing issues is the ongoing geopolitical tensions,
which will continue to shape the macroeconomic
landscape and future outlook. Uncertainty will play a
key role in the coming years.**

The recent U.S. presidential election, ongoing tensions in
the Middle East, the war in Ukraine and the slowdown of
the economic growth in China, are all factors contributing
to trade disruptions, increased anti-globalization, more
protection mechanisms, increased protectionist policies,
supply chain disturbances, disrupting supply chains, a
change in climate policies and many other unpredictable
circumstances. On the other hand, increasing economic
power of India and projected growth of other emerging
Asian economies are expected to have a positive impact on
global macroeconomic development in the coming years.

```
Stabilization and recovery
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that
global economic growth will remain stable, with a
projected 3.2 percent increase in 2025, similar to 2024.
This performance is considered mediocre compared to
the pre-pandemic averages. Inflation is on a downward
trend, with global headline inflation expected to decrease
to 4.4 percent in 2025. Suriname has faced significant
macroeconomic challenges in recent years, but recent
macroeconomic indicators and reports from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
indicate signs of stabilization and recovery. The World
Bank predicts similar numbers to the IMF.
```
```
According to the IMF, Suriname’s GDP is expected to
grow by 3.0 percent in 2025. The Surinamese government
has focused on improving its fiscal position through debt
restructuring and phasing out subsidies. The country’s annual
Financial Plan 2025 emphasizes the need for a manageable
budget deficit and provides for a further decline in government
debt as a percentage of GDP (currently at 97%).
```
```
Increasing oil demand
The year 2025 and coming years will still show an increasing
demand for oil and a growth in production as well mainly
by the non-OPEC+ countries. The U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) forecasts that global liquid fuels
production will rise by 1.9 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2025
and an additional 1.6 million b/d in 2026. The International
Energy Agency (IEA) also anticipates that global oil demand
will increase in 2025, reaching a total of 103.9 million
b/d. In summary, the oil industry in 2025 is characterized
by increasing production, particularly from non-OPEC+
countries, and a modest rise in global demand driven mainly
by emerging Asian economies.
```
```
The most significant benchmark for oil prices is Brent Crude.
The EIA projects that Brent Crude will average US$ 74 per
barrel in 2025, decreasing to US$ 66 per barrel in 2026,
US$ 64 in 2027 and US$ 66 in 2028. In 2022 the realized
Brent Crude price was US$ 93 per barrel, in 2023 US$
77 per barrel and in 2024 US$ 80 per barrel. Overall, the
trend is downward and attributed to robust growth in global
production outpacing demand, leading to increased oil
inventories and exerting downward pressure on prices.
The impact on oil prices is significant on the profit of
Staatsolie and the contribution of Staatsolie to the
Government of Suriname.
```
## Macroeconomic Environment

**15**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


```
Improved medium-term outlook
In 2024, Suriname made significant progress on the
macroeconomic front. Suriname has been engaged in an
economic reform program supported by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) through a 36-month Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) arrangement worth US$ 688 million.
The IMF Executive Board has reviewed the program
multiple times and has noticed the progress, most recently
at the ninth review under the EFF arrangement. The IMF
Board acknowledged the country’s commitment to prudent
macroeconomic policies and challenging reforms, which have
resulted in economic growth, declining inflation, and renewed
investor confidence. For instance, inflation has decreased
from sixty to ten percent, and the national debt to GDP ratio
has declined from 140 to below 97 percent.
```
```
Notably, the announcement of a Final Investment
Decision (FID) for the GranMorgu project in Block 58
offshore Suriname has significantly improved Suriname’s
medium-term economic outlook. Preparations for offshore
development will generate substantial economic activity
in sectors such as supply chain management, hospitality,
construction, port operations, housing, and transportation
for expatriates.
```
```
Welfare Fund
With the expected start of offshore oil production by 2028
and the implementation of policies aimed at fair distribution
of oil revenues, Suriname is on the eve of economic
transformation. However, it is crucial that the government
continues to focus on sustainable development and
diversification of the economy to avoid dependence on the
oil and gas sector and ensure long-term economic stability.
```
```
From this perspective, the Spaar- en Stabiliteitsfonds
Suriname (Welfare Fund) has been established and activated
by the government to manage oil and gas revenues.
The fund’s governance structure has been revised and
strengthened to ensure transparency and accountability.
For the future stability of Suriname and the well-being of
current and future generations, it is crucial that this fund
is used as intended and that its governance framework is
effectively implemented.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Staatsolie’s Finance directorate oversees the company’s
2024-2033 Investment Program and leads process
improvement measures designed to help Staatsolie
achieve the best-in-class standards required to
collaborate with IOCs and other global partners. In 2024
the company has delivered once again solid results and
contributions to the Government of Suriname.**

```
We have built a solid financial foundation for
Staatsolie to participate in GranMorgu and
possible future projects.
```
```
Agnes Moensi-Sokowikromo
Finance Director/CFO
```
```
Market Factors
Staatsolie’s solid financial year included revenues of US$ 735
million (US$ 722 million in 2023), and pre-tax profits of US$
430 (US$ 426 million in 2023). Market factors impacting 2024
results included:
```
- Our refinery turnaround, which involved a planned
    shutdown for quadrennial maintenance; this operational
    downtime impacted our production capacity and,
    consequently, our sales volume of high-end refined
    products.
- Slightly higher oil prices
    (US$ 78 per barrel vs. US$ 77 in 2023).
- An adjustment to the Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA)
    with the Government of Suriname, with effect starting
    September 2024, leading to an adjustment in hydro power

A Focus on Offshore Funding
With TotalEnergies announcing the FID for the GranMorgu
project in Block 58, the key focus for Finance in 2024 was
to prepare for the financing for Staatsolie’s participation in
the project, for up to a maximum of twenty percent. A track
record of solid performance disciplined financial management
and sustained relationships with international, regional and
local banks, as well as local and regional investors, has
placed Staatsolie in a strong position to participate in the first
offshore development. According to our latest estimates, this
twenty percent level of participation will require Staatsolie to
```
# Finance

```
contribute approximately US$ 2.4 billion. Potential funding
avenues include a bond issuance, investing our own cash,
term loans and/or partnerships. In pursuance of this strategy,
a local bond was issued in January and closed in March
2025 with issuance amounts of US$ 468,745,200 and
€ 4 3 , 4 8 5 ,10 0.

### 2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**2024-2033 Investment Program**
Staatsolie’s 2024-2033 Investment Program is focused
primarily on offshore development, while also investing in
maximizing onshore value, accelerating the transition of the
power business, optimizing downstream and gold operations
and continue to pursue excellence and executing our long-
term strategy.

```
Internal Process Improvements
In 2024, Finance led the way in strengthening the company’s
internal control environment, with key advances made in
areas of Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process improvements,
Enterprise Risk Management maturity, Internal Control over
Financial Reporting (ICFR) training and risk and control
matrix (RACM) gap analysis. Order to Cash (OTC) and
Information technology general controls (ITGC) assessments
have been conducted by third party experts in preparation for
the company to transition from a substantive audit approach
to a controls-based audit approach.
```
```
Improvements were also made in Data Analytics, including
centralizing the function and executing a data warehouse
migration to Microsoft Azure to improve data access and
security. The new environment is being made ready for
advanced analytics capabilities for financial purposes, all
of which will be further utilized in the coming years. From
monitoring expenses to forecasting revenues, improved data
access and insights will improve our ability to make timely,
informed decisions across all directorates.
```
```
Controlling Costs
In 2024, cost increases were driven by inflation, higher
energy prices, and rising costs for EOR chemicals and fuel.
Additionally, unexpected thermal power repairs, deferred
overhauls, and expenses from the scheduled quadrennial
refinery turnaround resulted in higher maintenance costs and
impacted overall efficiency.
```
```
These increases were compensated by the effects of long-
and short-term initiatives to increase efficiency, including:
```
- The Smart Field Initiative to improve operational efficiency
    and reduce field control costs.
- Elimination of barging to lower transportation expenses.
- Optimization of chemical consumption through the
    desalination unit.
- Reduction of electricity costs in High Fluid Rate (HFR)
    wells through the installation of Permanent Magnet Motors.
- Off-gas utilization and fuel optimization to enhance
    refinery efficiency.
- Reduction in external consultants where possible.

```
These measures helped control costs while maintaining
operational efficiency and long-term sustainability.
```
```
Gold Performance
Staatsolie has a participating interest in the gold mines of
Merian, Newmont and Pikin Saramacca, Rosebel Goldmines
(Zijin). Results in 2024 were positively impacted by higher
gold prices and higher volumes in 2024. Profits before tax for
Newmont amounted to US$ 45 million, compared to US$ 30
million in 2023; profits before tax for Zijin Rosebel Gold Mines
were US$ 33 million, compared to US$ 2 million loss in 2023.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**The Upstream directorate manages the production
of Saramacca crude from onshore oilfields located
in Suriname’s Saramacca District. The Tambaredjo,
Calcutta and Tambaredjo Northwest oil fields produce a
total of more than six million barrels annually.**

# Upstream

```
Thanks to a range of improvement projects,
the Upstream directorate achieved another
record year of crude production in 2024.
```
```
Rekha Bissumbhar
Upstream Director
```
```
Production Results
In 2024, Staatsolie achieved a record production of 6.41
million barrels of Saramacca Crude, surpassing both the
target of 6.34 million barrels and the previous year’s record
of 6.27 million barrels. This increase was primarily driven by
the Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) High Fluid Rate Project and
the TA58 treatment plant upgrade, which reduced incoming
pressure and enabled further production optimization in key
zones of the Tambaredjo Field. These initiatives, along with
the addition of five new producers, contributed to exceeding
the production target by 73 thousand barrels.
```
```
This strong performance was accomplished despite several
significant operational challenges:
```
- Enhancing asset integrity and reliability by clearing the
    backlog of major maintenance on tanks and field piping.
- Managing rising water production and declining reservoir
    pressures across various field areas.
- Maintaining a safe work environment amidst
    intensified activities.
- Replacing experienced staff, many of whom transitioned to
    the Offshore Directorate or retired/exited the company.

Sustaining Production Levels
Through ongoing facility and process improvements—along
with the continued implementation of proven Enhanced
Oil Recovery (EOR) and Improved Oil Recovery (IOR)
techniques—Staatsolie is focused on maintaining an
onshore upstream production level of approximately
6 million barrels per year of Saramacca Crude for the years
ahead. To support this production sustaining strategy,
a 10-year multi-annual plan is reviewed and updated
annually, based on reserves assessments and the
performance of implemented EOR/IOR programs.
```
```
Reserves
As of 31 December 2024, Staatsolie’s proved reserves stand
at 104.5 million barrels, as verified by an independent audit.
In 2024, we added 9.18 million barrels to our reserves from
existing fields through ongoing IOR/EOR initiatives. These
additions came primarily from the Cyclic Steam Stimulation
project (28%), the High Fluid Rate Project (13%), and other
regular optimizations which contributed to reduced production
decline and reserve increases in the Tambaredjo Field (28%)
and the Tambaredjo North-West- and Calcutta (TNW-CAL)
Field (31%).
```
```
At the end of 2023, proved reserves were 101.73 million
barrels, of which 6.41 million barrels were produced in 2024.
The reserve additions resulted in a Reserves Replacement
Ratio (RRR) of 1.5 (5-year average), exceeding the target
RRR of 1.4.
In 2024, two appraisal wells were drilled near the producing
Tambaredjo and TNW fields. One of these was successful
and is scheduled for further production testing in 2025.
```
```
Exploration activities are ongoing in Coronie, the Uitkijk area,
and Weg naar Zee, in addition to IOR/EOR and appraisal
programs in existing fields — all aimed at strengthening
Staatsolie’s onshore reserve base.

Controlling Costs
In 2024, Staatsolie maintained its position as lowest cost
quartile producer in South America, with a production cost
of US$ 9.56 per barrel, compared to US$ 9.28 in 2023.
Despite rising costs—primarily due to increased utility tariffs
and higher chemical expenses associated with polymer
flooding—we remained focused on controlling costs across
operations.
```
Key cost-control measures included:

- Implementation of a Smart Field Initiative to reduce
    production losses.
- Cost savings from fewer barging trips, made possible by
    the Produced Water Re-Injection project.
- Building internal capabilities to reduce reliance on external
    consultants and expatriate support.

## Refinery

```
Production Results
The production target for 2024 was set at 2.9 MM barrels of
high ends (i.e. diesel and gasoline) which was also reached
on 31 December. This number should be compared with the
2020 turnaround where a total of 2.58 MM barrels of high-
ends were achieved or the previous non-turnaround year
2023 in which 3.16 MM barrels of high-ends were produced
to supply the market. Approximately 3.22 million barrels of
fuel oil and bitumen were produced, compared to 1.89 million
barrels in 2023.
```
```
As stated before, production volumes are influenced by our
scheduled refinery turnaround (see below) which reduces
high-end production and increases fuel oil production, as
during this period crude is sold as fuel oil. The cost per barrel
in 2024 was US$ 8.72, compared to US$ 8.51 in 2023.
```
**Staatsolie’s Downstream directorate oversees activities
including the production of high-end diesel and gasoline
at our Refinery, power generation at our hydro and
thermal power plants and the sales and marketing of our
refinery products and GOw2, our subsidiary retail chain.**

```
Highlights for the Downstream directorate
in 2024 included a successful refinery
turnaround, addressing of power generation
challenges, (including low lake level due to

operations, we plan a temporary shutdown of the refinery
to execute a maintenance turnaround. Over seven weeks
in February and March 2024, we executed the scheduled
Turnaround on-time, within budget and without any Lost-
time Injuries (LTIs). More than 800 different activities
were conducted in areas of inspection, cleaning, repair,
replacement and testing of equipment and systems, and
more than 900 Staatsolie and contractor employees were
involved in the work. Several improvement projects were
carried out, contributing to more efficient refinery operations,
with highlights including:
```
- Replacing catalysts for hydrogen, diesel and
    gasoline plants.
- Performing all statutory inspections to ensure
    process safety.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


_Power_

**Power Generation Results**
Through our subsidiary Staatsolie Power Company Suriname
N.V. (SPCS), Staatsolie generates electrical power from a
189 MW hydropower facility in the district of Brokopondo and
a 96 MW thermal power plant in the Wanica district. SPCS’
primary customer is the Government of Suriname, acting as
the purchaser of electrical energy for the national grid.

In 2024, SPCS generated approximately 1.42 million
megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity, accounting for 67
percent of Suriname’s electricity demand. Approximately 42
percent of the electricity was supplied from the hydro power
plant and 25 percent from the thermal power plant. There
were zero blackouts on the national grid due to interruptions
in SPCS operations.

```
Meeting Challenges
Levels of power generation in 2024 were impacted by
challenges such as weather conditions, equipment failure
and maintenance downtime. Excessive drought, in particular,
posed challenges to hydro power generation. Attributed to the
El Niño impact, drought conditions and a significant drop in
the hydro reservoir level caused SPCS to lower hydro power
generation to 90 MW during a few months through the year.
We will continuously monitor conditions and adjust
hydropower generation levels as circumstances warrant.
Generation results were adversely affected by both a
comprehensive maintenance overhaul and an engine
malfunction at the thermal power plant.
```
```
Maintaining and Improving Facilities
Hydro
SPCS is continuing a multi-year initiative to increase the
generating capacity of its hydropower plant by upgrading
three fixed-blade turbines to Kaplan-type turbines.
Once all six of the facility’s turbines are modernized to the
Kaplan-type, we project a minimum of five percent increase
in power generation efficiency, while maintaining the same
water inflow volume.
```
```
In 2024, annual preventive maintenance programs were
conducted on five of the six hydroelectric units, with the
remaining one conducted in January 2025. We also replaced
the last transformer in the Afobaka Main Switchyard to further
improve transmission reliability, completing the renewal of all
three critical main transformers in the switchyard.
```
```
Thermal
At the thermal power plant, five out of eight engines had their
regular maintenance overhauls in 2024. In 2025, the CAT
Engine #1 will undergo repair, and the remaining engines are
scheduled to have their regular maintenance overhauls. We
have also upgraded the automation system of the CAT plant,
while deploying operational excellence concepts to minimize
recurring technical difficulties. In 2024, we also advanced the
technical feasibility study for a new Battery Energy Storage
System (BESS).

Progressing on Our Solar Plant
Pending approval from regulatory authorities, Staatsolie
intends to construct a new solar power plant with a
generating capacity of 30 megawatt-peak (MWp). Along with
the grid operator, we have decided to locate the solar plant at
Saramacca proximate to Staatsolie’s onshore oil production
fields, rather than at the previously considered Afobaka
location. To that end, we have begun a topographical survey
and an ESIA study. Further execution depends on the
successful signing of a power purchase agreement (PPA) for
solar energy with the Government of Suriname.
```
**Enhancing Safety**
In accordance with our “Zero Harm” core value, we are
proud to have achieved zero recordable injuries in our power
operations in 2024, and we look to continue this trend going
forward. Throughout the year, safety engagement sessions
were held with the workforce, resulting in the implementation
of comprehensive action plans. Dam safety remained
our highest priority. Implemented measures included
regular underwater inspections and the expansion and
rehabilitation of observation wells. Additionally, a third-party
assessment was conducted to evaluate potential upgrades
to dam safety monitoring through automated solutions.
Furthermore, we enhanced our crisis management plan
through comprehensive consultations with advisory
teams of Brazilian industry specialists and representative
from the Brazilian Civil Defense. We have also upgraded
fire detection systems at all locations and are currently
developing a Business Continuity Plan.

SPCS successfully received recertification of ISO-45001
(Safety), ISO-14001 (Environment) and ISO-9001 (Quality)
management systems. Additionally, a third-party electrical
safety audit was conducted, and plans for implementing the
recommended follow-up actions have been established.

```
Serving the Refinery
Aside from the Government of Suriname, SPCS’ secondary
customer is the Staatsolie refinery. In addition to thermal
electrical energy, the refinery purchases process steam that
is co-generated in the thermal plant, utilizing waste heat.
To strengthen our ability to ensure a stable electricity supply,
we are exploring and implementing solutions to enhance
resilience against fluctuations in the distribution network due
to external factors, such as power dips.

environmentally responsible manner. TotalEnergies’ plan for
developing the new GranMorgu project includes:
```
- Routine, with the reinjection of produced all-natural gas to
    enhance recovery.
- A fully electric configured FPSO.
- Optimized power usage with a waste heat recovery unit.
- Optimized water cooling.
- A permanent methane-monitoring system to reduce
    emissions to below 16 kilograms of carbon per barrel of
    oil produced.

```
For 15 years Staatsolie is a proud parter of Suriname Conservation Foundation Green Partnership Program (SGPP).

Promoting Biodiversity
Staatsolie is committed to preserving Suriname’s precious
biodiversity by minimizing the loss of natural habitats and
protecting ecosystems, flora and fauna and water quality in
areas affected by our Upstream operations. Our rigorous
environmental monitoring is conducted in collaboration with
Suriname’s Forestry Department and includes activities such
as an annual aerial survey to identify and protect breeding
bird colonies in the Coppename Monding Nature Reserve.
This is because some of our oil fields border this reserve.
Additionally, we work closely with Conservation Suriname to
safeguard the North Saramacca Multiple Use Management
Area (MUMA), where several Upstream oilfields, the TA58
crude treatment plant, polymer plant, and waste treatment
facilities are located. Measures include restricted access to
our concessions and prohibiting hunting and fishing. As a
member of the Suriname Conservation Foundation Green
Partnership Program, Staatsolie actively supports initiatives
that raise awareness and protect nature.
```
```
Reducing Emissions
Our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include:
```
- Endorsing the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by
    2030 initiative. At our refinery, we have reduced routine
    flaring by utilizing off-gases as a feedstock for hydrogen
    production, replacing naphtha, which allows for increased
    gasoline production while significantly lowering our
    CO 2 footprint.
- Implementing measures including flare gas recovery,
    compressor capacity improvements, vent-to-flare
    conversions and vent-recovery initiatives.
- Utilizing sweet gas as feedstock in the hydrogen
    production unit (HPU) to lower emissions at the flare in
    our refinery process.
- Preparing to utilize sweet gas as feedstock in the
    refinery’s Vis Breaker unit, as well.
- Investing in advanced detection and monitoring
    technologies to reduce methane emissions.
- Converting four heater-treaters from crude to gas power
    in Upstream operations.
- Utilizing methane gas in the heater-treater system of our
    Upstream oil production operations.

```
Corporate Governance
In 2024, the Staatsolie’s Corporate Governance activities
focused on further enhancing the compliance structure
with regards to laws & regulations, policies & procedures.
Continuous monitoring, review and improvement of
implemented policies and procedures is recognized
as necessary to make the company resilient to future
developments. With the development of a compliance
application and document control application, the
Governance, Risk & Compliance division strives to monitor
and report on the controls over the compliance within the
company. In collaboration with the Board of Executive
Directors (BoED), the Supervisory Board (SB), and various
divisions, the applicable charters have been revised to align
with the updated requirements.
```
```
Furthermore, significant enhancements have been made to
our financial reporting framework, reinforcing our internal
controls and thus increasing reliance on financial reporting
for our stakeholders. Adherence to good governance and
compliance practices has played a key role in achieving our
strategic goals. Ongoing efforts are focused on maintaining
and strengthening the partnership between the BoED and
SB to support the organization’s long-term success and
sustainability.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Enterprise Risk Management**
Staatsolie is striving for sustainable growth and value
creation, and partly to this end, Staatsolie is strengthening
its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework by
identifying, assessing and mitigating risks in all divisions of
our company. Today and with future offshore developments,
Staatsolie faces a wide range of emerging risks, including
fluctuations in global oil prices, geopolitical instability,
changes in environmental regulations and operational risks
associated with exploration, production and transportation
of oil and related products. Our ERM-policy stipulates to use
robust controls and risk mitigation measures to minimize
potential impact of events on our strategic goals.
The Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors
are actively involved in monitoring Staatsolie’s ERM policy to
ensure its effectiveness and to secure the achievement of the
strategic objectives in the forthcoming period.

```
The Staatsolie ERM framework supports both the goal
of zero harm and value creation by facilitating informed
decisions, addressing current and emerging risks associated
with the company’s profile.
Taking into account the ISO 31000 and COSO principles,
internal controls based on the 3 Lines of Defense principle
are being developed and implemented; the focus is on the
identification, analyses, evaluation and proper management
of risks.
The ERM database is being used by the third Line of Defense
(LoD) for its audit profiling.
```
```
Operational business units manage day-to-day risks.
Annually, the BoED and key management review the
enterprise risks and adjust the mitigation strategy as needed.
The Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) division
```
```
oversees enterprise risk assessments, monitors the risk
profile and adherence to the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS),
and tracks mitigation strategy and compliance. The BoED
and SB provide overall ERM framework oversight.
```
```
For Staatsolie, the following areas are the focus of
Enterprise Risk Management because, individually or
in combination, they can harm our company’s strategic
objectives: catastrophic event, price volatility, financing
& funding, business resilience, information security,
human capital, business continuity, governance and public
perception/reputation.
```
```
Through means of an ERM application the controls and
related actions are monitored and updated in order to
manage the risks Staatsolie is exposed to. Furthermore,
Staatsolie has recognized the importance of conducting
a horizon scan with the goal of identifying emerging
risks related to the future developments that Staatsolie
will engage in. A close involvement of the responsible
employees, BoED, the Supervisory Board’s Risk &
Compliance Committee and GRC will ensure a robust risk
management and control system.
```
```
In general, Staatsolie manages its risks by maintaining
a diversified portfolio, including the gold business, and
working along rigorous frameworks and financial scenarios.
Enterprise risk assessments are conducted in alignment with
established risk appetite and tolerance.
Operational and project risks are managed at several levels,
including our quality process, investment process, and project
risk assessments for projects exceeding US$ 250,000.

**GranMorgu: The first Offshore Development**
On 30 September 2024, Staatsolie approved the
development plan for the GranMorgu field in Block 58, and
on 1 October, TotalEnergies announced its Final Investment
Decision (FID) for the project. Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman
and CEO of TotalEnergies, visited Suriname for the occasion.
The operation will consist of a Floating Production Storage
and Offloading (FPSO) vessel with the capacity to produce
220,000 barrels of crude oil per day from 16 production
wells with 16 injection wells. The first oil production from the
GranMorgu project is scheduled for 2028. TotalEnergies is
the operator in partnership with APA Corporation in Block

58. Staatsolie is in the process of securing the funding of
the back-in-right of up to twenty percent in this milestone
offshore development.

```
Pursuing Major Gas and Oil Opportunities in
Block 52
In another significant advance, Staatsolie signed a Letter
of Agreement (LoA) with the Malaysian NOC Petronas for
Block 52. The LoA outlines the key terms and conditions for
developing a gas field in Block 52, where a gas discovery
was made with the Sloanea-1 exploration well in 2020. As a
result of the LoA, the Sloanea-2 appraisal well, including the
first-ever gas production test offshore Suriname, was drilled
in the second quarter of 2024 with positive results. Based
on this success, Petronas has initiated pre-development
activities and is working towards an FID by the end of 2026.
```
```
This was not the only major news from Block 52. In May
2024, Petronas confirmed a discovery at the Fusaea-1
exploration well in the block. This discovery is being further
evaluated to determine the reservoir properties. Studies
will be conducted to assess the potential for developing the
Fusaea-1 discovery together with the 2023 Roystonea-1
discovery and further exploration. Two exploration wells are
committed to be drilled in 2025. The end-result may well be
a second FID for an oil development offshore Suriname as
early as 2027.
```
```
Contracts for major production facilities have been signed,
securing a significant portion of the capital investment.
Construction of the FPSO unit is underway. In the coming
years, wells will be drilled, subsea installations and pipelines
will be laid, and modules will be installed on the already
acquired floating platform. Operational activities for drilling
the wells will be conducted from Suriname, directly benefiting
the local economy.
```

Promoting Local Content
With the advent of offshore development officially underway
with the GranMorgu project, Staatsolie is continuing to
enable opportunities for local content, encouraging the
employment of local labor and the local procurement of
goods and services. To help Surinamese businesses meet
IOC standards and compete with international companies,
Staatsolie launched the BlueWave Supplier Development
Program, in collaboration with ExxonMobil and Chevron,
in 2023. Twenty-five businesses participated in 2023, and in
2024 thirty additional companies benefited from a six-month
program that included workshops, documentation access and
personalized coaching. IOCs and their sub-contractors spent
approximately US$ 30 million on locally procured goods and
services in 2024.
```
**New PSCs in Blocks 14 and 15**
In 2024, SHI held its second Shallow Offshore Bid Round,
which closed on 31 May 2024 and resulted in two new
production sharing contracts (PSCs). On 13 September,
Staatsolie and PetroChina Investment Suriname,
a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation,

```
signed PSCs for offshore blocks 14 and 15. With these
contracts, PetroChina has obtained the exploration,
development, and production rights in both blocks.
Staatsolie, through its subsidiary Paradise Oil Company
N.V. (POC), holds a thirty percent participating interest.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Ongoing Exploration**
Going forward, several IOCs are set to continue their
exploration activities in their respective blocks.
Five exploration wells have been committed:

- To further explore the oil discoveries in Block 52, two
    exploration wells will be drilled in the second half of 2025.
- In Block 64 the Macaw-1 exploration well will be drilled in
    the second quarter of 2025.
- In Block 5 the Korikori-1 well will be drilled in the fourth
    quarter of 2025.
- In Block 65 the Araku Deep-1 well will be drilled by the end
    of 2025.

As of the end of 2024, about half of the Surinamese offshore
area is under contract. Under the auspices of SHI, Staatsolie
will continue to market the remaining unexplored areas,
emphasizing the wealth of geological information now
available, as well as the incoming data from seismic and
other geological surveys currently underway. The aim is to
contract as much of the offshore acreage as possible.

consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated
statement of other comprehensive income, consolidated
statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the
consolidated financial statements, including material
accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31
December 2024 and its consolidated financial performance
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”). Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics
Standards Board of Accountants’ International Code of
Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period.
These matters were addressed in the context of the audit
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in
forming the auditor’s opinion thereon, and we do not provide
a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below,
our description of how our audit addressed the matter is
provided in that context.

## 41

### 2024 ANNUAL REPORT


We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
statements section of our report, including in relation to these
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements. The results of our audit procedures, including
the procedures performed to address the matter below,
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

**Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

Estimation of decommissioning and restoration provisions.

```
Provisions associated with decommissioning and
restoration are disclosed in Note 4.9 to the consolidated
financial statements; a description of the accounting
policy and key judgements and estimates is included
in Note 2.4. The total decommissioning and restoration
provisions reported as at 31 December 2024 was
US$ 20.6 million (2023: US$ 24.9 million).
```
```
The calculation of decommissioning and restoration
provisions is conducted by internal and external specialist
engineers and requires the use of significant judgement
in the application of key assumptions in respect of
asset lives, timing of restoration work being undertaken,
environmental legislative requirements, the extent of
restoration activities required and estimation of future
costs. Changes in these assumptions may result in
material changes to the decommissioning and restoration
provisions recorded by the Group and as a result is
considered a key audit matter.
```
```
Our audit procedures focused on the work of the Group’s
internal and external specialists.
```
In obtaining sufficient audit evidence, we:

- assessed the competence and objectivity of both the
    Group’s internal and external specialists involved in
    the estimation process;
- assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions
    utilized by the specialists in the determination of the
    provisions;
- understood the Group’s decommissioning and
    restoration estimation processes;
- tested the consistency in the application of principles
    and assumptions to other areas of the audit such as
    reserves estimation and impairment testing;
- tested the mathematical accuracy of the net present
    value calculations and discount rate applied;
- reconciled the calculations to the financial report
    prepared by internal and external specialists;
- reviewed the disclosure and presentation of the
    provision estimates recorded by management and
    related disclosures in the consolidated financial
    statements with reference to the requirements of IFRS
    Accounting Standards.

Responsibilities of Management and
Supervisory Board for the Consolidated
Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, and for such
internal control as management determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
```
```
In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
```
```
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the
Group’s financial reporting process.
```
**Other information included in the Group’s 2024
Annual Report**
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report
thereon, the annual report contains other information that
consists of Supervisory Board and Management reports.
Management is responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not
cover the other information and we do not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit
of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.

**43**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated
financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of
    the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
    or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
    to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
    and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
    The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
    from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
    fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
    misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to
    the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
    appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
    expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
    internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used
    and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
    related disclosures made by management.

```
We also provide the Supervisory Board with a statement
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.
```
```
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board,
we determine those matters that were of most significance
in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a
matter should not be communicated in our report because
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of
    the going concern basis of accounting and based on the
    audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
    exists related to events or conditions that may cast
    significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a
    going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
    exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
    report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
    financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
    to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
    audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
    report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
    Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
    of the consolidated financial statements, including the
    disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
    statements represent the underlying transactions and
    events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient
    appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial
    information of the entities or business units within
    the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the
    consolidated financial statements. We are responsible
    for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work
    performed for the purposes of the group audit. We remain
    solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.

these ventures.

With regard to Staatsolie’s gold participation interests, since
November 2014, Staatsolie has a participating interest of
25% in the Suriname Gold Project CV (‘Surgold’), a limited

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**The material accounting policies applied in the
preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below.**

```
2.1 Basis of preparation
Staatsolie’s consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The significant
accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements are set out below. The historical cost
convention applies, however, certain assets and liabilities,
including investment properties and financial instruments,
are measured at fair value. Unless stated otherwise, these
accounting policies have been applied consistently to the
years covered in these financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use
of estimates and assumptions based on experience and
considered appropriate by management given the specific
circumstances. These estimates and assumptions affect the
carrying amounts and presentation of reported assets and
liabilities, off-balance-sheet rights and obligations, reported
income and expenses, and the accompanying disclosures
throughout the year. The actual outcomes may differ from the
estimates and assumptions used.
Section 3 – 7 to the financial statements gives further
information on the areas and items in the financial statements
where estimates and assumptions are used. Unless stated
otherwise, all amounts reported in these financial statements
are in thousands of US dollars.
```
```
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
data of Staatsolie and its controlled subsidiaries as at
31 December 2024. Subsidiaries are companies over
which Staatsolie, either directly or indirectly, has the power
to govern the financial and operating policies so as to
obtain benefits from their activities. In determining whether
Staatsolie has control, actual and potential voting rights
that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into
account, along with the existence of other agreements
enabling Staatsolie to control financial and operating policies.
```
```
The assets, liabilities and results of subsidiaries are fully
consolidated. Intra-group transactions and balances are
eliminated in full on consolidation.
The results of consolidated subsidiaries that have been
acquired during the year are consolidated from the
date Staatsolie obtains control over those subsidiaries.
Consolidation of subsidiaries ceases from the date Staatsolie
no longer controls the subsidiary.

# other significant accounting policies

## 54

### 2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**2.3 General accounting policies**

**a. Revenue recognition**
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when
control, along with the associated risk and rewards of the
products has been transferred to the customer at an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and
the Group fulfilled its performance obligation. For the sales,
control is transferred at delivery of the products or upon
pickup by the customer from the Group’s premises. Revenue
recognition is based on the transaction price specified in the
contract, net of returns, discounts, value added taxes and
excise taxes collected on behalf of third parties. The Group
has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue
arrangements since it controls the goods or services before
transferring them to the customer.
For the sale of oil products, the point of transfer is either at
the point of delivery or the point of receipt, depending on
contractual conditions.

Revenues resulting from sale of thermal & hydro energy
generation are generally recognized when Staatsolie Power
Company Suriname (SPCS) fulfils its performance obligation
by transferring the affirmed goods (electricity and steam) to
the customer and once product has passed the meters the
customers obtain control of the product.
Revenue resulting from hydrocarbon production from
properties in which Staatsolie has an interest with partners in
joint arrangements is recognized on the basis of Staatsolie’ s
volumes lifted and sold.
Gold revenue is recognized upon transfer of gold bullion
credits to the customer, as this is the point at which the
customer obtains the ability to direct the use and obtain
substantially all of the remaining benefits of ownership of
the asset. This can occur when gold doré is delivered to the
buyer’s refinery, upon delivery of the gold doré, or upon being

loaded to air transport and flight departure in Suriname.

```
b. Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)
Property, plant and equipment include assets owned by the
Group expenditure related to major inspections. PP&E are
recognized at historical cost less accumulated depreciation
and impairment losses. Historical cost includes all
expenditure directly attributable to the purchase of an item of
property, plant and equipment or the production of an item of
property, plant and equipment for own use.
The cost of production for the Group’s own use includes
the direct costs of materials used, labour and other direct
costs attributable to the construction of the item of property,
plant and equipment and the costs required to bring it into its
operational condition.
The PP&E of the Group is subdivided into the
following categories:
```
- Oil exploration and producing properties
- Refining properties
- Other property, plant and equipment
Expenditures incurred after an item of PP&E has been put
in use are capitalized only if they are expected to generate
future economic benefits and be reliably measured.
Depending on the specific circumstances, these costs are
either included in the carrying amount of the related asset
or are capitalized separately. The carrying amount of the
original asset is derecognized on replacement.

```
Repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred.
The present value of expected decommissioning and
restoration costs related to provisions asset retirement
(Section “provisions”), certain development cost (Section
“research and development”) and the impact of associated
cash flow hedges (Section “financial instruments”) is
```
```
recognized in the consolidated statement of financial
position, provided if it is probable that these costs will
result in future economic benefits.
```
```
The costs of production development such as drilling,
testing and completion of development wells are capitalized,
notwithstanding if these wells are successful or not.
Capitalized costs consist of the purchase price of materials
and services, including the Group’s internal services.
All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment,
and related Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) are
capitalized.
```
```
Assets under construction refer to tangible or intangible
assets that are being developed or constructed, but are
not yet completed and ready for use and consist, among
others, of the exploration and evaluation expenditures, all
expenditure on the construction, installation or completion
of infrastructure facilities such as pipelines, the drilling of
development wells or refinery facilities.
Any net costs incurred in testing the assets are
capitalized. Development projects are recognized
as ‘Producing assets’ when the facility is moved to
the production stage. New developments or major
improvements are always capitalized.
```
```
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost,
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment
losses recognized.
```
```
An asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount
will be recovered principally through sale rather than through
continuing use, which is when the sale is highly probable,
and it is available for immediate sale in its present condition
subject only to terms that are usual and customary for
```
**55**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


sales of such assets. Assets classified as held for sale are
measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale and the
associated liabilities are presented separately from other
assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Once assets are classified as held for sale, PP&E and
intangible assets other than goodwill are no longer subject
to depreciation or amortization.

**c. Research and development**
Development costs that are expected to generate probable
future economic benefits are capitalized as intangible
assets. All other research and development expenditure is
recognized as an expense when incurred.

**d. Exploration and evaluation assets**
Costs directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to
determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential
of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons,
including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons
were not found, are initially capitalized as projects in
progress. All such capitalized costs are subject to technical,
commercial and management review, as well as review for
indicators of impairment at least once a year.

**e. Investment properties**
Investment properties are defined as properties held by an
entity to earn rental income or for capital appreciation (or
both) or for a currently undetermined future use. Investment
properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties
are stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at
the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes
in the fair values of investment properties are included in
profit or loss in the period in which they arise, including the

```
corresponding tax effect. Fair values are determined based
on an annual valuation performed by an accredited external
independent valuer applying a valuation model recommended
by the International Valuation Standards Committee.
```
```
Investment properties are derecognized either when they
have been disposed of (i.e., at the date the recipient obtains
control) or when they are permanently withdrawn from
use and no future economic benefit is expected from their
disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or
loss in the period of derecognition. In determining the amount
of consideration from the derecognition of investment property
the Group considers the effects of variable consideration,
existence of a significant financing component, non-cash
consideration, and consideration payable to the buyer (if any).
```
```
Transfers to or from investment property are made only when
there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment
property to owner-occupied property, the deemed cost for
subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of the
change in use. If a property is reclassified as an investment
property, the Group continues to account for it in accordance
with the policy stated under PP&E up to the date of the
change in use.
```
```
f. Depreciation/amortization
Oil properties are depreciated/amortized on a Unit of
Production (UOP) basis over the total proved developed
reserves of the field concerned. The UOP rate calculation
for the depreciation/amortization of field development costs
takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together
with sanctioned future development expenditure.
Other PP&E are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives, which is generally 25 years
```
```
for the refinery, and major inspection costs are amortized
over three to five years, which represents the estimated
period before the next planned major inspection.
Projects in progress are not depreciated.
```
```
Power plant assets
The power plant assets are depreciated on a straight-line
basis and as follows:
Asset Category Percentage
Building hall 5%
Production hall 10%
Furniture 33.33%
Tank bat ter y 20%
Powerhouse equipment 5 - 50%
Other units 5 - 20%
```
```
Asset Category Percentage
Building hall 10%
Telecommunication equipment 20%
Dock TLF 4%
Oil tanker 10%
Drilling machinery 20%
Heavy equipment 20%
Transportation equipment 33.33%
```
```
Corporate and Other fixed assets
Land and freehold estates are not depreciated. Other
properties outside the production field are being amortized
on a straight-line basis. The annual depreciation percentages
are as follows: where applicable a residual value is taken into
consideration.
```
```
Derecognition of PP&E
PP&E is de-recognized when it is sold or when no future
economic benefits are expected from its use. Gains or
losses on sale of PP&E are presented in the statement of
profit or loss as other income; losses on sale are included in
depreciation expense.
```

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there
is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If there
is any indication of impairment, or if an asset is subject
to mandatory impairment testing, the Group estimates
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating
unit’s (CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its
value in use. It is determined for an individual asset,
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are
largely independent of those from other assets or groups
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal,
recent market transactions are taken into account.
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate
valuation model is used.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are
recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss
in those expense categories consistent with the function
of the impaired asset, except for a property previously
revalued where the revaluation was taken to OCI. In this
case, the impairment is also recognized in OCI up to the
amount of any previous revaluation.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31
December and when circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined
for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each
CGU to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable
amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an

```
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortization period and the amortization method
for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed
at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes
in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the
asset are considered to modify the amortization period
or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes
in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on
intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the
statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is
consistent with the function of the intangible assets.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible
asset, are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying balance of the asset and
are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the
asset is derecognized.
```
```
h. Impairment of intangible assets
Intangible Assets are tested for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts for those assets may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
```
```
Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired
and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal,
recent market transactions are taken into account.
```
```
impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating
to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
```
```
g. Intangible assets and goodwill
Intangible assets are initially recognized in the consolidated
statement of financial position at historical cost where
it is probable that they will generate future economic
benefits. This includes capitalization of decommissioning
and restoration costs associated with provisions for asset
retirement (see “provisions”), certain development costs
(see “research and development”). Interest is capitalized
as an increase in PP&E, on major capital projects during
construction. The accounting for exploration costs is
described separately (see “exploration costs”).
```
```
Goodwill is initially measured, at acquisition date, as the
excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and
the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest over
the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. The amount recognized
for any non-controlling interest is measured as a percentage
of the identified net assets of the acquiree based on the
present ownership’s proportionate share.
If the consideration transferred is lower than the fair value
of acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities, the
difference (negative goodwill) is recorded as income.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as a minimum, or
when there are indications of impairment. Impairment losses
relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
```
```
Intangible assets may be finite, or indefinite lived and
are carried at cost, less any accumulated amortization
(calculated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives) and
accumulated impairment losses.
Finite intangible assets are amortized over the useful
```
**57**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate
valuation model is used.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are
recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss
in those expense categories consistent with the function
of the impaired asset, except for a property previously
revalued where the revaluation was taken to OCI. In this
case, the impairment is also recognized in OCI up to the
amount of any previous revaluation.

**i. Financial assets & liabilities**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the
net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of
financial position if there is an enforceable legal right to
offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis.

**A. Financial assets**
At initial recognition, financial assets are classified as:

- amortized cost,
- fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI),
    and
- fair value through profit or loss.
This classification depends on the financial asset’s
contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s
business model for managing them. The Group’s business
model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages
its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The
business model determines whether cash flows will result
from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial
assets, or both.

**Financial Assets at amortized cost:**
Financial assets are measured at amortized cost if the goal is

```
to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual cash
flows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that
are solely payments of principal and interest. The subsequent
valuation is done by using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR)
method. The valuation is also subject to impairment. Gains
and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is
derecognized, modified or impaired. Debt instruments (such
as trade receivables) are measured at amortized cost.
```
```
Financial Assets at fair value (through profit and loss /
through other comprehensive income)
Financial assets held for trading (selling or repurchasing in
the future) are initially recognized at fair value (through profit
and loss) plus or minus transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset.
Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the
asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.
If financial assets are not held for trading, they are
initially recognized at fair value (through OCI). All equity
instruments and other debt instruments are recognized at
fair value. Dividends received on equity instruments are
recognized as other income in profit or loss when the right
of payment has been established, except when the Group
benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the
cost of the financial asset, in which case such gains are
recorded in OCI.
```
```
Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognized in the following
circumstances:
```
- The right to receive cash flows related to the asset has
    expired.
- The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows
    from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the
    received cash flows in full without material delay to a third

```
party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either
(a) the Group has transferred the risks and rewards of the
asset, or
(b) the Group has transferred control of the asset.
In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated
liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations
that the Group has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee
over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum
amount of consideration that the Group could be required
to repay.
```
```
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit
losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value
through profit or loss. ECL method is based on the difference
between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with
the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to
receive, discounted at an approximation of the original EIR.
The expected cash flows includes cash flows from the sale
of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are an
integrated part of the contractual terms.
```
```
Credit exposures with a significant increase in credit risk, a
loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the
remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the
default (a lifetime ECL). Credit exposures without a significant
increase in credit risk, the ECL is applied to calculate the
credit losses that result from default events that are possible
within the next 12 months.
```
```
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical
```
**58**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors
specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

The Group considers a financial asset in default when
contractual payments are 90 days past due. However,
in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial
asset to be in default when internal or external information
indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding
contractual amounts in full, before considering any credit
enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written
off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the
contractual cash flows.

**B. Financial liabilities**
Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, unless
they are required to be measured at fair value through profit
or loss, such as instruments held for trading. Financial
liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred
for the purpose of repurchasing in the near future.

Debt and trade payables are recognized initially at fair value
based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs, and
subsequently at amortized cost. Interest expense on debt is
recognized using the EIR method, and except for capitalized
interest, is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
For financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value
option, the change in the fair value related to own credit risk
is recognized in OCI. The remaining fair value change is
recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

Interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortized cost using the EIR method.
Gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized
as well as through the EIR amortization process.

```
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in
the statement of profit or loss.
```
```
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. When an
existing financial liability is replaced by a new contract with
the same lender on substantially different terms, the existing
liability is derecognized and the new contract is recognized
as a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying
amounts is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit
or loss.
```
```
j. Provisions
Provisions are recognized at management’s best estimate of
the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. Non-
current amounts are discounted at a rate intended to reflect
the time value of money. If the effect of the time value of
money is material, provisions are discounted using a current
pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific
to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in
the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a
finance cost in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
```
```
Provisions for decommissioning, which arise in connection
with hydrocarbon production facilities, oil products
manufacturing facilities and pipelines, are measured on the
basis present price levels; the present value is calculated
using amounts discounted over the useful economic life of
the assets. Costs related to restoration of site damage during
production are recognized in profit or loss.
```
```
The liability is recognized once a constructive obligation
arises to dismantle an item of PP&E when a reasonable
estimate can be made.
```
```
Revisions in the estimate of the provision are reflected on a
prospective basis, generally by adjustment to the carrying
amount of the related PP&E. However, where there is no
related asset, or the change reduces the carrying amount to
nil, the effect, or the amount in excess of the reduction in the
related asset to nil, is recognized in the profit and loss.
```
```
Provisions related to warranties are recognized when the
product is sold or the service is provided to the customer.
Initial recognition is based on the estimated costs of fulfilling
warranty obligations. The provision estimate is reviewed and
adjusted annually to reflect any changes in assumptions or
expected costs.
```
```
Decommissioning liability
The Group recognizes a decommissioning liability where it
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate
of the amount of obligation can be made.
The obligation generally arises when the asset is installed,
or the ground/environment is disturbed at the field location.
When the liability is initially recognized, the present value of
the estimated costs is capitalized by increasing the carrying
amount of the related oil assets to the extent that it was
incurred by the development/construction of the field.
```
```
Any decommissioning obligations that arise through the
production of inventory are expensed when the inventory item
is recognized in cost of goods sold. Additional disturbances
which arise due to further development/construction at the
oil and gas property are recognized as additions or charges
to the corresponding assets and decommissioning liability
when they occur. Costs related to restoration of site damage
(subsequent to start of commercial production) that is created
```
**59**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at
their net present values and recognized in profit or loss as
production continues.
Changes in the estimated timing or cost of decommissioning
are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to
the provision and a corresponding adjustment to oil and gas
properties. Any reduction in the decommissioning liability and,
therefore, any deduction from the asset to which it relates,
may not exceed the carrying amount of that asset. If it does,
any excess over the carrying value is taken immediately to the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
If the change in estimate results in an increase in the
decommissioning liability and, therefore, an addition to the
carrying value of the asset, the Group considers whether this
is an indication of impairment of the asset as a whole, and if
so, tests for impairment. If, for mature fields, the estimate for
the revised value of oil and gas assets net of decommissioning
provisions exceeds the recoverable value, that portion of the
increase is charged directly to expense.
Over time, the discounted liability is increased for the change
in present value based on the discount rate that reflects current
market assessments and the risks specific to the liability.
The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss as a finance cost.

**k. Joint arrangements and business combinations**

**_Joint arrangements_**
Staatsolie has 2 types of joint arrangements:
I. Joint operation:
Staatsolie has rights to the assets, and obligations for the
liabilities, proportional to its participating interest.
II. Joint Venture:
Staatsolie has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

```
I. Joint operations
All assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are accounted
for the share of the group’s participation in the joint
arrangement.
In April 2020, Staatsolie entered into an Unincorporated Joint
Venture (UJV) with Rosebel Gold Mines N.V. (“Rosebel”)
named Pikin Saramacca. Rosebel, established on 8 May
2002, is a subsidiary of IAMGOLD Corporation.
The UJV is governed by the Mineral Agreement dated
7 April 1994, as amended, the UJV agreement and the
Accounting manual both signed on 22 April 2020. In this
UJV, the participating interest is thirty percent for Staatsolie
and seventy percent for Rosebel and the latter has been
appointed as the UJV operator. The group’s investment in the
UJV is considered a joint operation.
As of 1 February 2023, Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd became the
UJV operating partner instead of Rosebel.
```
```
GranMorgu: First Offshore Development
On 30 September 2024, Staatsolie approved the
development plan for the GranMorgu field in Block 58, and
on 1 October, TotalEnergies announced its Final Investment
Decision (FID) for the project. Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman
and CEO of TotalEnergies, visited Suriname for the
occasion. The operation will consist of a Floating Production
Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel with the capacity to
produce 220,000 barrels of crude oil per day from sixteen
production wells with sixteen injection wells. The first oil
production from the GranMorgu project is scheduled for
```
2028. TotalEnergies is the operator in partnership with
APA Corporation in Block 58. Staatsolie is in the process
of securing the funding of the back-in-right of up to twenty
percent in this milestone offshore development.

```
II. Joint ventures
The Group has a 25% participation in the Suriname Gold
Project CV (SurGold) Limited partnership. The Group’s
investment in the limited partnership is considered a joint
venture and is recognized at (historical) cost. The value
of the investment at reporting date is the net cashflow of
the investments and proceeds. The Group accounts for its
investment in the limited partnership, using the equity method
in accordance with IAS 28 - Investments in Associates and
Joint Ventures.
```
```
Accordingly, The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s
share of the results of operations of the limited partnership,
and Newmont Mining Corporation the remaining 75%.
Any change in OCI of the investee is presented as part of
the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change
recognized directly in the equity of the limited partnership, the
Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable,
in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of the
limited partnership is shown on the face of the statement
of profit or loss outside operating profit and included in the
consolidated profit or loss before tax.
```
```
The financial statements of the limited partnership are
prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Impairment is calculated as the difference between the
recoverable amount of the joint venture and its carrying value
and recognizes the loss as ‘Share of participation result in a
JV’ in the statement of profit or loss.
```
```
Business combinations
A business combination is defined as a transaction or other
event in which Staatsolie obtains full control of one or more
businesses. A business is defined as an integrated set of
```
**60**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


activities and assets capable of generating returns, consisting
of inputs and processes that together contribute to the
creation of outputs. Business combinations are measured at
the cost of the acquisition at the fair value of the price paid. In
case of shared control, please refer to the joint arrangements.

The costs of an acquisition are measured at acquisition date
on the basis of fair value. Contingent consideration classified
as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within
the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is measured at
fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss in accordance with
IFRS 9. Other contingent consideration that is not within the
scope of IFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting
date with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.

**l. Lease Accounting**
IFRS 16 addresses the assessment of whether an
arrangement contains a lease, even if it does not take the
legal form of a lease. It applies to agreements that grant
the right to use a specific asset such as a property, plant or
equipment for a defined period.
A right of a purchaser to use a particular asset owned
by a supplier could be conveyed in a wide range of
arrangements for the supply of goods and services,
including outsourcing arrangements, arrangements
under which a purchaser obtains a right to capacity
(e.g., the output of a particular power plant) and take-or-
pay arrangements or similar contracts.

At the inception of a contract, an entity should assess
whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or
contains, a lease if the contract gives the right to control the
use of an identified asset (‘underlying asset’) for a period of
time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the

```
use of an identified asset can be split into:
a. the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits
from use of an identified asset and
b. the right to direct the use of an identified asset.
```
```
a. Right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits
To control the use of an identified asset, a customer
is required to have the right to obtain substantially all
the economic benefits from use of the asset during
the period of use. The most obvious way of obtaining
substantially all the economic benefits from use of the
asset is having exclusive use of the asset during the
period of its use.
The lessee should focus on economic benefits arising
from the use of the asset (e.g., obtaining products), not
from the ownership of the asset (e.g., tax credits).
```
```
b. Right to direct the use
A customer has the right to direct the use of an
identified asset during the period of use only if either:
the customer has the right to direct how and for what
purpose the asset is used during the period of use;
or the relevant decisions about how and for what
purpose the asset is used are predetermined.
```
- Under IFRS 16, lessors account for finance leases
    by initially derecognizing the asset and recognizing a
    receivable for the net investment in the lease which is
    the present value of the payments.
- The lessor must use the interest rate implicit in the
lease to measure the net investment in the lease.
- Subsequent to initial recognition, a lessor must
recognize finance income over the lease term, based
on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return
on the lessor’s net investment in the lease (i.e. it must
use the amortized cost method).

```
m. Fair value measurement
Fair value measurements are estimates of the amounts
for which assets or liabilities could be transferred at the
measurement date, based on the assumption that such
transfers take place between participants in principal
markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best
use into account.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in
the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to
measure fair value.
```
```
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured
or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are
categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole:
```
- Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest input
    that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or
    indirectly observable.
- Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
    unobservable.

```
For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the
consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring
basis, the Group determines whether transfers have
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing
categorization (based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the
end of each reporting period.
```
**61**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**n. Other income**
**_Interest income_**
For all financial instruments measured at amortized cost,
interest income is recorded using the effective interest
rate (“EIR”). The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the
expected future cash receipts of the financial instrument or a
shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount
over the expected life. Interest income is included in finance
income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

**_Dividends_**
Dividend is a distribution of a company’s net profits to its
shareholders, typically in the form of cash payments or
additional shares. Dividends are usually declared by the
Board of Directors and require approval by the shareholders
at the annual General Meeting (AGM) before being paid.

**o. Foreign currencies**
The consolidated financial statements are presented in
United States dollars (US$), which is also the Group’s
functional and presentation currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional
currency and items included in the financial statements of
each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Subsidiaries that do not have US$ as functional currency
record their transactions at their functional currency rate
ruling at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in non-US$ currencies are translated to US$ at
the rate of exchange ruling as of reporting date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated
using exchange rates that existed when the values
were determined. Exchange differences on settlement
or translation of monetary items are recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

```
p. Hyperinflation accounting
Suriname has been identified as a hyperinflationary economy
based on the three-year cumulative inflation rates of
126% measured at year end 2024. Other hyperinflationary
characteristics of the economic environment were identified,
such as (i) the general population regards monetary amounts
in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency as prices
are often quoted in stable foreign currency, (ii) sales and
purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for
the expected loss of purchasing power, and (ii) the general
population prefers to keep wealth in non-monetary assets or
in a relatively stable foreign currency.
```
```
q. Ta xes
Income taxes comprise of current and deferred tax. Current
tax is based on the result for the year adjusted for items
which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable
temporary differences subject to certain specific exceptions.
Deferred tax is a tax payable or receivable in the future and
is recognized in respect of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and their tax treatment under applicable
tax laws. The amount of deferred tax provided is based
on the expected manner of recovery or settlement of the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates
(substantively) enacted, at year-end.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes
provisions where appropriate.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible
temporary differences and carry-forward of unused tax
```
```
losses, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit
will be available against which the temporary differences and
carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally
enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets
against current income tax liabilities, and the deferred taxes
relate to the same taxation authority.
```
```
r. Borrowing costs
Borrowings costs are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or
sale, are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. All other
borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they
occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that
an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
```
```
s. Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost or net realizable value,
whichever is lower. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell.
The cost of crude oil and refined products is the purchase
cost, the cost of refining, including the appropriate proportion
of depreciation, depletion and amortization and overheads
based on normal operating capacity, determined on a
weighted average basis.
```
```
Pipeline fill
Crude oil, which is necessary to bring a pipeline into working
order, is treated as a part of the related pipeline. This is
on the basis that it is not held for sale or consumed in a
production process but is necessary to the operation of a
facility during more than one operating cycle, and its cost
cannot be recouped through sale (or is significantly impaired).
```

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


This applies even if the part of inventory that is deemed to be
an item of PP&E cannot be separated physically from the rest
of inventory. It is valued at cost and is depreciated over the
useful life of the related asset.

**t. Cash and short–term deposits**
Cash and short-term deposits in the consolidated statement
of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and
short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less,
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows,
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term
deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts
as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash
management.

**_Restricted Cash_**
Restricted cash is required for financing purposes as this has
been the requirement of Staatsolie’s financiers. The restricted
accounts are the collection accounts; Debt Payment Account
(DPA) and the Debt Payment Reserve Account (DSRA).
The collection account is used for international collections
from all our international customers to deposit their
payments. The DPA account contains three months’ worth
of debt service and is funded monthly. Every three months
interest and principal, if any, is paid out.
The DSRA contains three months’ worth of interest for the
lifetime of the loan. After the necessary funding has taken
place, Staatsolie can obtain the remaining cash for its
operations.

**_Cash dividend_**
The Group recognizes a liability to make cash dividend
distributions to owners of equity when the distribution is
authorized, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion

```
of the Group. A corresponding amount is recognized directly
in equity.
```
```
u. Pensions and other post–employment benefits
Staatsolie employees are enrolled in defined benefit pension
plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of
post-retirement benefit that an employee will receive on
retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as
age, years of service and compensation.
The defined benefit plans are calculated annually by an
independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows
using interest rates. Since there are no local deep market
in high quality corporate bonds nor (long term) government
bonds on the market, the discount rate used was derived
at balance sheet date from the 10-year average interest
rates on high quality market corporate bonds on the United
States (US) market, corrected for US inflation and inflation in
Suriname.
The net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension
plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future
benefits that employees have earned in return for their
service in the current and prior periods; those benefits are
discounted to determine its present value. The fair value
of any defined benefit plan assets including qualifying
insurance policies is deducted from the present value of
the defined benefit obligation in determining the deficit or
surplus. The insurance policy is assumed to be a qualifying
insurance policy, meaning the value of the defined plan
assets is deemed to equal the present value of the related
obligations.
The current and past service costs of the defined benefit
plan are recognized in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income as employee benefit expense.
```
```
The interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate
to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation. This cost
is included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income within the finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial
assumptions are recognized in full immediately to OCI in
the period in which they arise. The defined benefit plans
expose the Group to actuarial risks such as interest rate risk,
longevity risk, and inflation risk.
```

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**2.4 Significant accounting judgments,
estimates and assumptions**
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial
statements requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the
accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and
estimates could result in outcomes that require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of asset or liability affected
in future periods.

Other disclosures relating to the Group’s exposure to risks
and uncertainties includes:

- Capital management
- Financial instruments, risk management and policies
- Sensitivity analyses disclosures

**Judgments**
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies,
management has made the following judgments, which have
the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements:

**_Investment in arrangements_**
Judgment is required to determine when the Group has joint
control over an arrangement, which requires an assessment
of the relevant activities and when the decisions in relation
to those activities require unanimous consent. The Group
has determined that the relevant activities for its joint
arrangements are those relating to the operating and capital
decisions of the arrangement, including the approval of the
annual capital and operating expenditure work program
and budget for the joint arrangement, and the approval of
chosen service providers for any major capital expenditure
as required by the joint operating agreements applicable to
the entity’s joint arrangements. The considerations made

```
in determining joint control are similar to those necessary
to determine control over subsidiaries, as set out in
Section 2.3b. Judgment is also required to classify a joint
arrangement. Classifying the arrangement requires the
Group to assess their rights and obligations arising from the
arrangement. Specifically, the Group considers:
```
- The structure of the joint arrangement – whether it is
    structured through a separate vehicle
- When the arrangement is structured through a separate
    vehicle, the Group also considers the rights and obligations
    arising from:
    - The legal form of the separate vehicle
    - The terms of the contractual arrangement
    - Other facts and circumstances, considered on a case by
       case basis
This assessment often requires significant judgment. A
different conclusion about both joint control and whether
the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture, may
materially impact the accounting treatment.

```
Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group applied the following judgements that significantly
affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue
from contracts with customers:
```
- Identifying performance obligations in a bundled sale of oil
    products and transportation services
    In some cases, the Group provides transportation services
    as part of contracts with customers when providing oil
    products. The Group determined that transportation
    services are not considered distinct performance
    obligations since this service to the customer is not
    considered to be separately identifiable from the sale of
    oil products to the customer, these are considered highly
    interrelated.
       - Identifying performance obligations in a bundled sale of oil
          products and equipment rental
          The Group makes equipment available to customers
          as part of contracts with customers when providing oil
          products. The Group determined that the sale of oil
          products and equipment rental are not capable of being
          distinct. The sale of oil products and equipment rental
          are highly interrelated because the Group would not
          be able to sell the oil products if the customer declined
          equipment rental.
       - Determining the timing of satisfaction of sale of oil products
          The Group determined that for contracts that are
          considered consignment arrangements, the obligation is to
          transfer the product to the consignee. The Group will not
          relinquish control of the consigned product until the product
          is sold to the end-customer. Consignees do not have any
          obligation to pay for the product, other than to pay the
          Group the agreed-upon portion of the sale price once the
          consignee sells the product to a third party. As a result, for
          consignment arrangements, revenue is recognized when
          the products are delivered to the end customer and the
          performance obligation has been satisfied.
       - Consideration of significant financing component in
          a contract
          Generally, the Group provides short-term advances to
          its customers. Using the practical expedient in IFRS
          15, the Group does not adjust the promised amount of
          consideration for the effects of a significant financing
          component if it expects, at contract inception, that the
          period between the transfer of the promised good or
          service to the customer and when the customer pays for
          that good or service will be one year or less.
          The Group also receives long-term advances from
          customers for the sale of oil products. However, since
          the timing of the transfer of these goods or services is at

**64**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


```
the discretion of the customer, this is not considered as a
significant financing component.
```
- Determining method to estimate variable consideration
    Some contracts for the sale of oil products give rise to a
    consideration payable to customers. In case the Group
    is not able to supply the customer with oil products in
    the timeframe as agreed in the contract and before its
    stock out date, the Group is liable for the difference
    between the price of a third party for the related oil
    products and the price as agreed in the contract. However,
    since the Group has no history of failing to deliver on
    contractual obligations, penalties are not considered upon
    determination of the transaction price.

**Estimates and assumptions**
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date,
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year, are described below. The Group based
its assumptions and estimates on parameters available
when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future
developments, however, may change due to market changes
or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group.
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they
occur.

**_Functional currency_**
The functional currency for the parent entity and each of
its subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates. The functional
currency for GOw2 is Surinamese dollar (SRD). The
functional currency for both Staatsolie and SPCS is the
US dollar (US$). Determination of functional currency may

```
involve certain judgements to identify the primary economic
environment and the parent entity reconsiders the functional
currency of its entities if there is a change in events
and conditions which determined the primary economic
environment.
```
```
Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables
The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for
trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its
historical observed default rates over the expected life of
the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking
estimates.
The default rate for the Group is determined as an average of
the write-offs compared to the outstanding trade receivables
balances using a window of a few years. This default rate
is then determined per age bracket by adjusting the rate to
align with the variation in the provision percentages per age
bracket. For credit balances no ECL is considered.
The Group expects the same pattern for the future, therefore
forward-looking estimates are not considered to have an
impact on the default rate.
At every reporting date the historical observed default rate
will be updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates
will be analyzed.
```
```
Decommissioning liability
Decommissioning costs will be incurred by the Group at
the end of the operating life of some of the Group’s facilities
and properties. The Group assesses its decommissioning
provision at each reporting date. The ultimate
decommissioning costs are uncertain and cost estimates
can vary in response to many factors, including changes
to relevant legal requirements, estimates of the extent and
costs of decommissioning activities, the emergence of new
restoration techniques or experience at other production
```
```
sites, cost increases as compared to the inflation rates of
2.28% (2023: 2.12%), and changes in discount rates of 9.93%
(2023: 5.99%). The expected timing, extent and amount of
expenditure may also change, for example, in response to
changes in oil and gas reserves or changes in laws and
regulations or their interpretation. Therefore, significant
estimates and assumptions are made in determining the
provision for decommissioning. As a result, there could be
significant adjustments to the provisions established which
would affect future financial results. The provision at reporting
date represents management’s best estimate of the present
value of the future decommissioning costs required.
```
```
Environmental risk liability
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognized when
a clean-up is probable, and the associated costs can be
reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of recognition of
these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal
plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of
inactive sites. The amount recognized is the best estimate
of the expenditure required. If the effect of the time value
of money is material, the amount recognized is the present
value of the estimated future expenditure.
```
```
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course
of business in relation to claims against the Group,
including legal, contractual and other claims. By their
nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or
more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The
assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of
contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant
judgment and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of
future events.
```
**65**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**_Recoverability of assets_**
The Group assesses each asset or cash generating unit
(CGU) (excluding goodwill, which is assessed annually
regardless of indicators) in each reporting period to
determine whether any indication of impairment exists.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate
of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to
be the higher of the fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD)
and value- in-use (VIU). The assessments require the use
of estimates and assumptions such as long-term oil prices
(considering current and historical prices, price trends and
related factors), discount rates, operating costs, future capital
requirements, decommissioning costs, exploration potential,
reserves and operating performance (which includes
production and sales volumes). These estimates and
assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore,
there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will
impact these projections, which may impact the recoverable
amount of assets and/or CGUs.

**_Units of production (UOP) depreciation of oil assets_**
Oil properties are depreciated using the UOP method over
the total proved developed hydrocarbon reserves. This
results in a depreciation/amortization charge proportional
to the depletion of the anticipated remaining production
from the field.
The life of each item, which is assessed at least annually,
relates to both its physical life limitations and present
assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the
field in which the asset is located. These calculations require

```
the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount
of recoverable reserves and estimates of future capital
expenditure. The calculation of the UOP rate of depreciation/
amortization will be impacted to the extent that actual
production in the future is different from current forecast
production based on total proved reserves, or future capital
expenditure estimates change. Changes to prove reserves
could arise due to changes in the factors or assumptions
used in estimating reserves, including:
```
- The effect on proved reserves of differences between
    actual commodity prices and commodity price
    assumptions.
- Unforeseen operational issues.

```
Hydrocarbon reserve and resource estimates
Hydrocarbon reserves are estimates of the amount of
hydrocarbons that can be economically and legally extracted
from the Group’s oil properties. The Group estimates its
commercial reserves and resources based on information
compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the
geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape
and grade of the hydrocarbon body and suitable production
techniques and recovery rates. Commercial reserves
are determined using estimates of oil in place, recovery
factors and future commodity prices, the latter having an
impact on the total amount of recoverable reserves and the
proportion of the gross reserves that are attributable to the
host government under the terms of the Production-Sharing
Contracts (PSCs). Future development costs are estimated
using assumptions as to the number of wells required to
```
```
produce the commercial reserves, the cost of such wells and
associated production facilities, and other capital costs.
The economic tests as of 31 December 2024, reserve
volumes were based on a future projection of crude oil prices
using crude oil prices forecasted by PIRA Energy group as
the reference price.
The calculated average price for the Tout Lui Faut (TLF) crude
oil receipts in 2024 is derived from the PIRA projected prices
for NYH No 6 Fuel Oil with a sulfur content of 1.0% which was
applied for all reserve categories less a transfer premium.
A 5-year moving average production-receipt ratio of 0.68%
(2023: 0.87%) was applied to capture the differences
between the volume of crude oil produced and the actual
volume received by the refinery.
Average price differential between the PIRA crude price
forecast as of 20 November 2024, and average posting price
of crude oil in 2024 was NIL (US$ 78.07/Bbl. versus actual
US$ 78.07/Bbl.) (2023 was US$ 0.44/Bbl.: PIRA US$ 77.35/
Bbl. versus actual US$ 76.91/Bbl.)

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


operation of a field, estimates of recoverable reserves
may change. Such changes may impact the Group’s
reported financial position and results, which include:

- The carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets;
    oil properties; property, plant and equipment; and
    goodwill may be affected due to changes in estimated
    future cash flows.
- Depreciation and amortization charges in the consolidated
    statement of profit or loss may change where such charges
    are determined using the UOP method, or where the useful
    life of the related assets change (Section 4.1).
- Provisions for decommissioning may require revision -
    where changes to reserves estimates affect expectations
    about when such activities will occur and the associated
    cost of these activities (Section 4.9).
- The recognition and carrying value of deferred tax assets
    may change due to changes in the judgments regarding
    the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely
    recovery of such assets (Section 3.3).

**_Defined benefit plans (pension benefits)_**
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post-
employment medical benefits and the present value of the
pension obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions
which may differ from actual developments in the future.
These include the determination of the discount rate, future
salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases.
Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying
assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined benefit
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, management

```
considers Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Pension
discount curve with maturities in accordance with the duration
of the plan at the statement of financial position date.
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality
tables for specific countries. Those mortality tables tend
to change only at intervals in response to demographic
changes. Future salary increases and pension increases are
based on expected future inflation rates for the respective
countries. Further details about pension obligations are
provided in Section 4.10.
```
```
Deferred tax
Judgment is required to determine which arrangements are
a tax on income as opposed to an operating cost. Judgment
is also required to determine whether deferred tax assets
are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial
position. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from
unutilized tax losses, require the Group to assess the
likelihood that the Group will generate sufficient taxable
earnings in future periods, to utilize recognized deferred
tax assets. Judgment is also required in respect of the
application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction.
Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits
depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows.
These estimates of future taxable income are based on
forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by
production and sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves,
operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs, capital
expenditure, dividends, and other capital management
transactions). To the extent that future cash flows and
taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability
of the Group to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded
at the reporting date could be impacted. In addition, future
changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Group
```
```
operates could limit the ability of the Group to obtain tax
deductions in future periods.
```
```
Oil properties
The application of the Group’s accounting policy for
exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgment to
determine whether economic benefits are likely from either
future exploitation or sale, or whether activities have not
reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment
of the existence of reserves. The determination of reserves
and resources is an estimation process that involves varying
degrees of uncertainty depending on how the resources are
classified. These estimates directly impact the timing of the
group’s deferral of exploration and evaluation expenditure.
The deferral policy requires management to make certain
estimates and assumptions about future events and
circumstances whether an economically viable extraction
operation can be established. Any such estimates and
assumptions may change as new information becomes
available. If, after expenditure is capitalized, information
becomes available suggesting that the recovery of the
expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalized amount is
written off in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in
the period when the new information becomes available.

**2.5 Changes in accounting policies
and disclosures**
There are no amendments or interpretations that are
effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2024, that have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements. The Group has not
early adopted any other standard, interpretation or
amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

```
Amendments to IFRS 16 - Lease Liability in a Sale
and Leaseback
The amendments in IFRS 16 specify the requirements that
a seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease liability arising
in a sale and leaseback transaction, to ensure the seller-
lessee does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss
that relates to the right of use it retains. The amendments
had no impact on the Group’s financial statements.
```
```
Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current
The amendments to IAS 1 specify the requirements for
classifying liabilities as current or non-current.
The amendments clarify:
```
- What is meant by a right to defer settlement
- That a right to defer must exist at the end of the
    reporting period
- That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an
    entity will exercise its deferral right
- That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability
    is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability
    not impact its classification
In addition, an entity is required to disclose when a liability
arising from a loan agreement is classified as non-current
and the entity’s right to defer settlement is contingent on
compliance with future covenants within twelve months.
The amendments have no impact on the Group’s
consolidated financial statement.

```
Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments to IAS 7
and IFRS 7
The amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures clarify the
characteristics of supplier finance arrangements and
require additional disclosure of such arrangements. The
disclosure requirements in the amendments are intended
to assist users of financial statements in understanding
the effects of supplier finance arrangements on an entity’s
liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk.
The amendments have no impact on the group’s
consolidated financial statement.

**2.6 Standards issued but not yet effective**

The new and amended standards and interpretations that
are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance
of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below.
The Group intends to adopt these new and amended
standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they
become effective.

```
Amendments to IAS 21-Lack of exchangeability
In August 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 21,
Lack of Exchangeability, to clarify how entities should
assess currency exchangeability and determine spot
exchange rates when exchangeability is lacking. These
amendments also require disclosures to help users
understand the impact of non-exchangeable currencies on
financial performance, position, and cash flows.
The amendments will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Early
adoption is permitted but will need to be disclosed.
When applying the amendments, an entity cannot restate
comparative information.
```
```
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial
Statements
In April 2024, the IASB issued “IFRS 18-Presentation
and Disclosure in Financial Statements”, replacing “IAS
1-Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements”.
IFRS 18 introduces new presentation requirements
for the statement of profit or loss, including specified
totals and subtotals. It mandates classifying all income
and expenses into five categories: operating, investing,
financing, income taxes, and discontinued operations.
The standard also requires disclosure of management-
defined performance measures, subtotals of income
and expenses, and new aggregation and disaggregation
requirements based on the roles of the primary financial
statements and notes.
Additionally, narrow-scope amendments to IAS 7 include
changing the starting point for cash flows from operations
under the indirect method to ‘operating profit or loss’ and
removing optionality around classification of cash flows
from dividends and interest. There are also consequential
amendments to several other standards.
```
```
IFRS 18, and the amendments to the other standards,
is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2027, but earlier application is permitted and
must be disclosed. Staatsolie will be assessing the impact
of the adoption of IFRS 18 and will apply the standard
from its mandatory adoption date of 1 January 2027.
```
```
IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability:
Disclosures
In May 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 19, which allows
eligible entities to elect to apply its reduced disclosure
requirements while still applying the recognition,
measurement and presentation requirements in other
IFRS accounting standards. To be eligible, at the end of
the reporting period, an entity must be a subsidiary as
defined in IFRS 10, cannot have public accountability
and must have a parent (ultimate or intermediate) that
prepares consolidated financial statements, available for
public use, which comply with IFRS accounting standards.
IFRS 19 will become effective for reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2027, with early
application permitted.

These functions are defined as the operating segments of the
Group for the following reasons:
```
1. They engage in business activities from which
    revenues are earned and expenses are incurred.
2. Their operating results are regularly reviewed by
    the board of executive directors to make decisions
    regarding resource allocation and performance
    assessment.

```
The corporate segment comprises the Group’s functional
departments, including SHI, the offshore directorate, and all
other corporate administrative functions.
The board of executive directors (which collectively is
considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker)
monitors the operating results of its business units separately
for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation
and performance assessment. Segment performance is
evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured
consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated
financial statements.
```
**This section provides additional information that is
most relevant in explaining the Group’s consolidated
performance during the year.**

- Segment information (Section 3.1)
- Information about key items comprising operating profit/
    loss (Section 3.2)
- Income tax (Section 3.3)
- Earnings per share (Section 3.4)
- Dividends paid and proposed (Section 3.5)

```
3.1 Segment information
For management purposes, Staatsolie is organized into
reportable segments that include three operating segments
and a corporate segment.
```
The three operating segments are:

- Upstream onshore: this segment is responsible for
    exploring, developing, producing, and transporting crude
    oil to the refinery.
- Downstream: is responsible for refining the crude oil,
    marketing, selling, and distributing the related oil products.
    Furthermore, trading which is related to trading fuel
    products and selling these products to wholesale, retail,
    and bunkering customers. Lastly, part of this segment is
    also the 96-megawatt thermal power plant operation and a
    Hydro dam facility, which delivers the electric power to the

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Adjustments and eliminations**

- Finance income and costs, and fair value gains and losses
    on financial assets are allocated to individual segments.
- Capital expenditure consists of additions of property, plant
    and equipment and intangible assets including assets from
    the acquisition of subsidiaries.
- Inter-segment revenues are eliminated on consolidation.

**Explanation of non-IFRS reconciliations and definitions**
This Annual Report includes one non-IFRS financial
measure, namely earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), that is not prepared
in accordance with IFRS and is therefore considered a
non-IFRS financial measure. The Group calculated EBITDA
by taking the net income and adding back interest, taxes,
depreciation, impairment and amortization.

As EBITDA is used by management as a key performance
indicator, the Group believes that it is useful to be presented
to the readers of the consolidated financial statements.

```
The revenue information above is based on the location of the customers.
In 2024, revenue from three major customers exceeded ten percent of the Group’s consolidated revenue, similar to 2023 (three
major customers). These customers collectively accounted for approximately 32% of the Group’s reported revenues in 2024,
compared to 37% in 2023. These transactions were primarily derived from sales within the downstream segment.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


Non-current assets for this purpose consist of oil exploration
and producing properties, refining properties, other property,
plant and equipment, investment properties, right - of-use
assets and other intangible assets.

```
Revenues consist of the sales and trade activities of
petroleum products, thermal - and hydro energy and gold.
Petroleum products are generally being sold at prevailing
market prices. Revenues are recognized when products
are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken
title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership,
prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is
reasonably assured.
```
```
Gold revenue is being recognized when the performance
obligation of transferring gold inventory to the customer
is satisfied, which generally occurs upon transfer of gold
bullion credits to the customer, as this is the point at which
the customer obtains the ability to direct the use and obtain
substantially all of the remaining benefits of ownership of
the asset.
```
```
Sales between group companies (intersegment sales)
are based on prices generally equivalent to commercially
available prices.

Block 58 GranMorgu
Staatsoile has an up to twenty percent back-in-right to
participate in the GranMorgu Project in Block 58 offshore
Suriname. The total contribution in 2024 amounted to
US$ 175 million.
```
Of this amount:

- US$ 127,500 was classified as a prepayment (refer to
    section 6.2). This amount represents an advance for
    expected future expenditures and will be offset against
    actual billings once incurred.
- The remaining US$ 47,500 was capitalized as Assets
    Under Construction (AUC) (refer to Section 4.1).

```
The split in the above-mentioned amounts is based on
the coherence of three components, namely the cash call
payment, the costs report as of 31 December Staatsolie
received from TotalEnergies as the operator with regard to
Staatsolie’s share in the actual costs and the back-in-right of
Staatsolie of up to twenty percent.
```

expected to commence production in 2028. As operator,
TotalEnergies is responsible for executing the project

Impairment testing of goodwill
The Group performed the annual impairment test as at 31
December 2024.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations with
indefinite life has been allocated to one CGU (GOw2). The
carrying value (net assets including Goodwill) of this CGU
is US$ 47,917 at 31 December 2024 (US$ 42,540 at 31
December 2023).
The recoverable amount of the GOw2 CGU of US$ 114,481 at
31 December 2024 (US$ 64,817 as at 31 December 2023) has
been determined based on a value-in-use (VIU) calculation
using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by
the responsible director covering a five-year period.
The post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.44%
(2023: 16.25%), and cash flows beyond the five-year period
```

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


are extrapolated using a 2% (2023: 2%) growth rate that is the
same as the long-term average fuel consumption growth rate
for the petroleum products sector. As a result of the analysis,
management did not identify impairment for this CGU.
The GOw2 CGU forms part of the downstream reportable
segment. Applying a pre-tax WACC discount rate of 11.61%
(2023: 22%) to the cash flow projections provides the same
VIU for the CGU.

**_Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations_**
The calculation of VIU for the GOw2 CGU is most sensitive to
the following key assumptions:

- Gross margin
- Discount rates
- Oil prices
- Market share during the budget period
- Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the
    budget period

_Gross margins_
Gross margins are based on average values achieved in
the three years preceding the start of the budget period.
These are increased over the budget period for anticipated
improvements in the efficiency of operations. An increase of
2% (2023: 2%) per annum was applied based on economic
growth (quantities) of the CGU.

_Discount rates_
Discount rates represent the current market assessment of
the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the
time value of money and individual risks of the underlying
assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow
estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the
specific circumstances of the Group and its operating

```
segments and is derived from its WACC, with appropriate
adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGU.
The WACC considers both debt and equity, weighted 26.29%
(2023: 26.88%) debt versus 73.71% (2023: 73.12%) equity,
due to the debt-to-equity structure of the Group. The cost
of equity is derived from the expected return on investment
by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on the
interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service.
Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual
beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based
on publicly available market data.
```
```
Oil prices
Long-term forecasted oil prices are based on management’s
estimates and available market data.
```
```
Market share assumptions
These assumptions are important because as well as using
industry data for growth rates (as noted below), management
assesses how the CGU’s position, relative to its competitors,
might change over the forecast period. Management expects
the Group’s share of the oil retail products market to be stable
over the forecast period.
```
```
Growth rate estimates
Rates are based on economic growth rates, growth of
domestic product and relevant published research.
```
```
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Regarding the assessment of VIU for the GOw2 CGU,
management believes that there are no reasonably possible
changes in any of the above key assumptions that would
cause the carrying value of the CGU to materially exceed its
recoverable amount.

**4.6 Investment properties**

```
Staatsolie acquired the land located in Wageningen,
District Nickerie in 2009. The investment properties are
measured at fair value at each Statement of Financial
Position date. Initially the land accommodated the Ethanol
Business of Staatsolie which was cancelled in 2015.
An external qualified valuator assessed the investment
properties as at 31 December 2024 and determined a fair

**4.7 Lease**

**Group as a lessee**
The Group has lease contracts for motor vehicles in its
operations. The motor vehicles generally have lease terms
between 3 and 5 years. The Group’s obligations under its
leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets.
Generally, the Group is restricted from assigning and
subleasing the leased assets.
There are several lease contracts that include extension and
termination options and variable lease payments, which are
further discussed below.

Set out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-
of-use assets and the movements during the period:

```
Group as lessor
As of 1 January 2020, the GoS acquired the Afobaka Dam
at no costs and transferred the ownership to SPCS. The
produced electricity is sold and delivered to the GoS. The
existing Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between SPCS
and the GoS has been amended and is still under review by
the GoS.
```
```
Given the interpretation of the IFRS guidelines that the
GoS is the sole shareholder of Staatsolie and ultimately
the shareholder of SPCS, and the fact that more than a
significant volume of the hydroelectricity is sold to GoS,
the GoS is in the position to direct the use of the hydro dam.

```
```
Other provisions
A provision at fair value of US$ 2,775 as at 31 December 2024
(US$ 3,587 as of 31 December 2023) mainly comprises:
```
- provisions for litigation or contractual claims;
    US$ 1,398 (2023: US$ 1,798). The claims are subject
    to legal arbitration and are not expected to be finalized

**4.10 Employee defined benefit liabilities**

The Group has three types of employee benefit plans,
namely pensions, post-employment benefits and other long-
term employee benefit plans. A summary of the net employee
benefit liabilities for the different benefits is shown in the table
below. The decrease in the provisions for employee benefits
plans compared to 2023 is mainly due to the increase in the
discount rate related to the weighted average life of the plans.

```
Pensions, other post-employment and other long -term
employee benefit plans
The Group has two defined benefit pension plans (funded),
one for the employees and one for the directors. The
employee pension plan is a final salary plan and requires
contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The director’s pension plan is an insured plan. In addition,
the Group provides certain post-employment and other long
-term benefits to employees (unfunded) such as healthcare,
excedent gratuity, funeral grants, pension gratuity, jubilee and
additional holiday allowances.

**Pensions
Employee pension plan**
The employee pension plan provides entitlements to
retirement and disability pension for the benefit of the
participant and widow’s, widower’s and orphans’ pension for
the benefit of the survivors. The pension entitlements are
accrued time-proportionately.
The pension entitlements are determined according to a
formula based on the pensionable salary and an employee
accrual rate of 2% per annum. The last pensionable
salary also applies to past service. Hence, an increase of
pensionable salary in future years will lead to an increase
of accrued pension entitlements. According to the formal
terms of the plan, for every year the pensionable salary is
determined by the Board of the pension fund according to
a formula.

The pension base percentage to calculate the pension
rights of the participants for financial year 2023 has been
set as calculated by the actuary at 100% of the annual
salary. The pension base percentage for financial year
2024 has not yet been determined by the Board of the
pension fund. The annual actuarial valuation, taking
into account the funding as at 31 December 2024 and
the salary increase as at 1 January 2024, has led to the
conclusion that a pension base percentage of 100% is
possible for financial year 2024. Therefore, it is assumed
that pension base percentage for 2024 will be set at 100%
of the annual salary as at 1 January 2024.

```
The retirement pension commences upon reaching the
retirement age of 60. However, a retirement age of 55 applies
to employees in certain special categories. The retirement
pension amounts to a maximum of 70% of the pension base
on the retirement date. The pension accrual rate is 2%.
```
```
Annually, the pensions in payment and deferred pensions
are adjusted on the basis of excess interest, which is the
difference between the return on the pension assets and
the actuarial interest of 4%, which is used to determine the
present value of the pension obligations of the fund.
```
```
The Staatsolie, SPCS and GOw2 employee pension plans
are administered by the “Stichting Pensioenfonds voor
Werknemers van Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V.”
(Pension Fund for Employees of Staatsolie Maatschappij
Suriname N.V.), for which all their entities have entered into
agreements with the fund.
```
```
The SPCS pension plan was established in January 2019.
The SPCS employees joined the pension plan as at that date
and pension benefits were awarded past service during their
employment with SPCS.
```
```
The GOw2 pension plan was established in January 2020.
The GOw2 employees joined the pension plan as at that date
and pension benefits were awarded past service during their
employment with GOw2.
```
```
The plans are financed by contributions and by the returns on
the plan assets. The employer’s and employee’s contributions
are limited to a maximum percentage of the participant’s
salary as set by the collective labor agreement.

Executive pension plan
The executive pension plan is a final pay scheme; the
pension base is equal to the salary. The pension plan
provides entitlements to retirement and disability pension
for the benefit of the participant and their widow’s,
widower’s, and orphans’ pension for the benefit of their
spouse and children.
```
```
The retirement pension commences upon reaching the age
of 60 and amounts to:
```
1. For Executive Board members designated by
    Staatsolie: at retirement 70% of the last salary.
2. For other Executive Board members: per year of
    service, up to a maximum of 28 years of service, 2.5%
    of the last salary.
The pension entitlements are accrued time-proportionately.
The disability pension is equal to the potential retirement
pension. The widow’s/widower’s pension is 70% of
the (potential) retirement pension. Upon termination of
employment of a participant who has participated in the
scheme for less than 3 years, the contributions paid by the
director shall be refunded. As soon as a participant who
has participated in the plan for at least 3 years, the director
shall be entitled to the pension entitlements accrued up
to the date of termination of employment. It is noted that
the 5-year period based on the “Wet Pensioenfondsen en
Voorzieningsfondsen” should be reduced to one year or less.

```
Pensions in payment and deferred pensions may be
increased in the event of a “general increase in the
cost of living”. This possibility has not been applied yet.
Pensions in payment and deferred pensions shall, in any
case, be adjusted annually based on profit sharing based
on excess interest, arising from the agreement with the
insurance company.
```
```
The pension entitlements arising from the plan are insured
with Assuria Levensverzekeringen N.V. (Assuria), for which
Staatsolie has entered into an agreement with, which
provides for profit sharing based on excess interest on assets
of Assuria.
```
```
The participants and Staatsolie contribute to the financing of
this plan. The participants contribute a set percentage of their
salary. Other costs of the plan are fully borne by Staatsolie.
```
```
The plan asset value for this insured executive pension plan
consists of the insurance policy covering participants. As
the insurance policy exactly matches the amount and timing
of the accrued pension entitlements of the participants, the
fair value of the insurance policy has been set at the present
value of the related obligations excluding any effects of future
salary increases.

The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the
impact on the defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions
occurring at the end of the reporting period. The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in
a significant assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analyses may
not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that
changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**4.11 Impairment testing of other
non-current assets**
The Group has assessed the recoverable amount of its cash-
generating unit as per the methodology described in section
2.4-Significant accounting policies, judgments, estimates
and the scenario consistent with its view of developing the oil
reserves in the current fields in the coming years, investment
strategy and future prices.
Management considered the development in crude oil prices,
oil construction and development activities around the world in
2015 through 2024.
As of 31 December 2024, the aforementioned factors appear
to have stabilized. Management concluded that there were no
indicators of impairment of Staatsolie’s CGUs, which include
three oil fields and the refinery.

However, for the SPCS Thermal Powerplant there was an
impairment recognized in 2024, similar to 2023 and 2022.
SPCS has assessed the recoverable amount of its cash-
generating unit, the thermal assets, as per the methodology
described in the summary of significant accounting policies
(section 2.3).

An impairment loss was recognized as a result of the
impairment test performed for the financial year 2024. The
factors considered for the impairment are the lower thermal
prices forecasted for 2025 and onwards based on our current
price in 2024 and furthermore expected increased opex
expenditures.

The main assumption is described below:

```
a. Future price development
For the thermal plant, fuel oil is a major input to generate
electricity. SPCS reviewed its expectations of future oil prices.
For the impairment assessment of the long-lived assets of the
thermal plant, the long term Pira reference prices NYH 1%
was used:
```
```
b. Discount rates
The post-tax discount rate of 8.62% (2023: 9.98%) used
by the Group is the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) after tax. This rate seeks to reflect current market
assessments regarding the time value of money and the
specific risks of the business. Therefore, the discount rate
used, consists of the risk-free rate, the country risk, the
currency in which the cash flows are generated and the
market, credit and business risk. The WACC consists of both
debt 48% (2023:44%) and equity 52% (2023:56%). Applying
a pre-tax WACC discount rate of 10.64% (2023:14.18%) to the
cashflow projections provides the same result.
```
```
Impairment recognized
Total impairment losses of US$ 1,441 (2023: US$ 3,076) were
recognized in respect of other property, plant and equipment.
The triggers for the impairment tests of these properties
were primarily the effect of adjustments in the assumptions
for electricity prices, volumes and capital expenditures. The
recoverable amount was based on management’s estimate of
value in use.

The Group is currently involved in ongoing legal claims
amounting to US$ 5,018 (2023: US$ 5,018), including interest
and court-imposed penalties, concerning the restoration and
repair of the water management system in Saramacca.
In July 2021, a judge ruled in summary proceedings,
rejecting the claim of the opposing party. However, the case
will continue in proceedings on the merits, with the claim
remaining unchanged since 2021.
Based on legal advice obtained, management believes that
the Group is in a defendable position and that no provision is
required as of 31 December, 2024.

**5.1 Issued capital and reserves**

The authorized share capital of Staatsolie as the parent of
the Group amounts to US$ 12,104 as at 31 December 2024
and is divided into 5 million shares. The earnings per share
for continuing operations were US$ 58.27 (2023: US$ 57.56).
During the year, the authorized share capital remained
unchanged.

Issued capital is as follows:

```
Reserve for environment risk
The environmental risk reserve is established to mitigate
potential environmental risk claims arising from damages
that may result from an environmental disasters during
ocean freight cargo deliveries. In addition, this reserve also
covers environmental damage associated with onshore
well operations. Based on historical data and experience,
the Group considers an annual allocation of US$ 500 to be
adequate as determined by the Board of Directors.
```
```
Non-Distributable Reserve Hydro dam
The Non- Distributable Reserve Hydro dam represents equity
arising from the transfer of the Afobaka Hydro-dam to SPCS
from the GoS.
As of 1 January 2020, the GoS acquired the Afobaka Dam
at no cost and transferred the ownership to SPCS.
The produced electricity is sold and delivered to the GoS.
The existing Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between
SPCS and the GoS has been amended and is still under
review by the GoS.
As the hydro dam was transferred at no cost by the GoS,
the transfer was ultimately recognized as a capital
contribution for the amount of US$ 16,398.

**5.2 Capital management**

For the purposes of Staatsolie’s capital management,
capital comprises issued capital and all other equity
reserves attributable to equity holders. The main objective
of Staatsolie’s capital management is to maintain a financial
structure that optimizes the cost of capital, enhances
shareholder value, and ensures access to financial markets
at a competitive rate. This approach supports sustainable
growth while maintaining healthy capital ratios in compliance
with financial covenants essential for the business.
To achieve this objective, the Group’s capital management
strategy focuses, amongst other things, on ensuring
compliance with the financial covenants associated with its
interest-bearing loans and borrowings, which are integral
to its capital structure requirements. A breach of these
covenants could grant lenders the right to demand immediate
repayment of the loans and borrowings. However, the Group
has remained in full compliance with all financial covenants in
both the current and prior periods.

The main financial covenants monitored by the Group are:

- The interest coverage ratio which is calculated by dividing
    the adjusted consolidated EBITDA by the financial
    expenses and income. For 2024 this ratio was 17.03 (2023:
    9.29); the minimum permitted is 3.50.
- The PV 10 ratio and the Petroleum PV 10 ratio were
    introduced with the refinancing in May 2018. “PV10” means
    the Net Present Value of the future net revenues and the
    calculated ratio (including Gold participations) for 2024 was
    9.71 (2023: 6.41); the minimum permitted is 1.30.
- The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the total debt
    by the adjusted consolidated EBITDA. For 2024 this ratio is
    0.68 (2023: 0.77); the maximum permitted is 3.00.

2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Local Bond**
On 23 March 2020, Staatsolie issued its third bond. The
bonds are for the period 2020 – 2025 with an annual interest
rate of 7% and for the period 2020 – 2027 for an annual
interest rate of 7.5%.

As at 31 December 2024, unamortized debt arrangement
fees for the third issued bond is included in the carrying
value. The amortization of debt arrangement fees for 2024 is
presented under finance cost in the consolidated statement
of profit or loss.

**Term Loan**
**_Corporate Term Loan_**
In 2018, Staatsolie closed on a US$ 625,000 term loan, an
uncommitted revolving loan of US$ 35,000 and the option
for an accordion of US$ 50,000 given certain conditions.
Repayment of the term loan was planned for 23 quarterly
installments, to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019.

On March 2022 Staatsolie and a consortium of banks led
by the Credit Suisse amended the loan agreement for
the existing loan of US$ 422,480. This loan agreement is
recorded under the name “Sixth amended and restated credit
agreement” and replaces the loan agreement under the
name “Fifth amended and restated credit agreement of
July 2020”.

Under this new loan agreement, the following is agreed on:

- Principal payments are deferred, and the repayment
    schedule is modified in terms of installments compared to
    the old loan agreement.
- Loan Maturity is now set for 2028.
    - Prepayment is allowed of total US$ 12.5 million instead
       of US$ 25 million previously; Staatsolie made the first
       payment in July 2022.
    - A cash sweep mechanism was introduced for additional
       repayments and building of the CAPEX reserve account.
       These amounts are calculated at the end of each quarter
       starting Q2 2022.

```
The outstanding loan amount as of 31 December 2024,
amounted to US$ 172,705 (2023: US$ 251,099) and a
revolving loan of US$ 6,000.
```
```
As at 31 December 2024, unamortized debt arrangement
fees are included in the carrying value.
The amortization of debt arrangement fees amounting to US$
2,270 for the year 2024 is presented under finance costs in
the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
```
```
Revolver
In March 2020, Staatsolie obtained a revolver loan of US$
6,000. This was used for working capital purposes.
```
```
Other long-term liability - Pikin Saramacca
For its acquisition of a 30% participating interest into an
Unincorporated Joint Venture (UJV) Pikin Saramacca on
April 2020 with Rosebel Gold Mines N.V., Staatsolie agreed
upon an initial contribution of US$ 54.8 million, of which
US$ 34.0 million was paid in cash and the remaining
US$ 20.8 million to be settled with Staatsolie’s Gold
Entitlement in accordance with the terms of the Second
Amendment and the UJV Agreement.
On 31 December 2023, the liability towards Rosebel Gold
Mines N.V. is recorded by Staatsolie at US$ 13.54 million.
In September 2024, due to better mining performance, cost
management and higher gold prices the liability towards
Rosebel Gold Mines N.V. was redeemed earlier than
forecasted and on the 31 of December 2024 Staatsolie
recorded a receivable of US$ 22.26 million (Section 5.3).
```
```
Fair Value
The initial recognition of the loans and bonds is at fair value
while the subsequent measurement is at amortized cost,
assuming the contractual interest rate equals the effective
interest rate. The local financial market consists of traditional
bank loans for business and is not capable to provide for the
capital needed for Staatsolie’s growth strategy. Staatsolie’s
finance structure comprises financing by a consortium of
international banks.
```
```
Staatsolie uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in
the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available
to measure fair value, maximizing the uses of relevant inputs
and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
```
```
All assets and liabilities, for which fair value is measured or
disclosed in the consolidated financial statements,
```
**113**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole:

- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
    directly or indirectly observable.
- Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
    unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the
consolidated financial statements on a recurring
basis, Staatsolie determines whether transfers have
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing
categorization (based on the lowest-level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at
the end of each reporting period.

**_Financial risk management objectives and policies_**
**Market risk**
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows
of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk:
commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency
risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include
loans and borrowings, deposits, trade receivables, trade
payables and accrued liabilities.

Market risks due to interest rate (SOFR) risk, plus a CAS
factor of 0.2626% have been accepted and is evaluated and
managed as part of the portfolio risk management policies.
In addition, Staatsolie monitors a desired ratio for its available

```
cash in US$ to fulfill its foreign currency business obligations.
Furthermore, Staatsolie accepts the risks of price fluctuations
of oil products, while takes into account a conservative low
price for its work program and yearly budget.
```
```
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure
to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with
floating interest rates.
```
```
Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a
reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of
loans and borrowings affected. With all other variables held
constant, the Group’s profit before tax is affected through the
impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:
```
```
x US$ 1 Increase / decrease in
basis points
```
```
Effect on profit before tax
Corporate term loan
```
```
2024 +60 (1,030)
US dollar -60 1,030
```
```
2023 +60 (1,509)
US dollar -60 1,509
```
```
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future
cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes
in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk
of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the
Group’s operating activities of subsidiary GOw2 (as revenues
and expenses are denominated in a foreign currency).
```
```
The Group manages trade transactions by offsetting local
payments and local receivables in SRD creating a natural
hedge for the SRD transactions.
```
```
As of that moment, all guarantees were placed in USD.
For that reason there is no foreign currency risk by the end
of 31 December 2024, similar to 2023.
```
**114**
2024 ANNUAL REPORT


**Commodity price risk**
The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in
prevailing market commodity prices on the mix of oil
products it produces. The Group’s policy is to manage
these risks through the use of contract-based prices with
customers. As mentioned in the market risk section above,
Staatsolie takes a conservative low-price approach for its
work program and budget.

The analysis is based on the assumption that changes in the
crude oil price result in a change of 10% in the sale prices
of the oil products, with all other variables held constant.
Reasonably possible movements in commodity prices were
determined based on a review of the last two years’ historical
prices and economic forecasters’ expectations.

```
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty
in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that
are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
```
```
The Group manages its liquidity risk based on reporting
covenants, encompassing sensitivity analysis for production
and conservative price assumptions, and restrained capital
expenditures. Furthermore, optional debt is available within
the credit agreement in accordance with the debt basket.
Cash in excess is being managed by the Corporate Treasury
department through “intercompany cash pooling” agreements
between Staatsolie and its subsidiaries.

Fair values
Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments,
other than those with carrying amounts that are reasonable approximations of fair values:
```
**Credit risk**
Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet
its obligations under a financial instrument leading to a
financial loss.

The Group trades with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade
on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures,
which include an assessment of credit rating, short-term
liquidity and financial position. In addition, receivable
balances are monitored on an on-going basis and GoS
receivables are settled with GoS payables. Section 6.2
shows an analysis of the trade receivable ageing.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date
using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses.
The provision matrix is based on its historical observed
default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables
and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. Generally,
trade receivables are written-off if past due for more than one
year and are not subject to enforcement activity.

With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial
assets of the Group, which comprise cash, short-term
investments and short-term deposits including restricted
cash, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default
of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the
carrying amount of these instruments. Cash, short-term
investments and short-term deposits, investments and
restricted cash are placed with reputable financial institutions.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying
value of each class of the financial assets as shown below:

The fair values of the financial liabilities are included at
the amount of which the instrument could be exchanged
at the reporting date between willing parties, other than in
a forced or liquidation sale. The fair values of the financial
liabilities are determined based on price quotations at the
respective reporting dates. The financial assets of the Group
approximate fair value and are therefore excluded from the
table on the previous page.

- Local bond: The fair value at each reporting date was
    obtained from the officially published numbers from the
    Dutch Caribbean Stock Exchange (DCSX).
- Revolver: the fair value of the Revolver equals the
    carrying value.
- Corporate term loan: IFRS 9 Recognition modification was
    applied for the fair value of the term loan.
- Other Long-term liability - Pikin Saramacca: the fair value
    of this loan equals the carrying value. The loan was repaid
    in September 2024.

```
```
In determining the recoverability of a trade or other
receivable, the Group performs a risk analysis considering
the type and age of the outstanding receivable and the
creditworthiness of the counterparties.
The Group does not track changes in credit risk but instead
recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each
reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix
that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted
for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the
economic environment.

**6.2 Trade and other receivables**

For terms and conditions relating to related party receivables,
