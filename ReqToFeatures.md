# Structure of the Implementation Story Documents

These implementation story documents follow a consistent five-part structure designed to clearly communicate the journey from problem to solution. Here's how each document is organized and what goes into each section:

## 1. Historical Context
**Purpose**: Documents the specific problems users are currently experiencing that prompted the need for change.
**Content**: Bullet list of concrete, specific issues users face with the current system.
**Tips**:
- Focus on real problems, not abstract concepts
- Use clear, concise language for each issue
- Be specific about how the current system is failing
- Avoid theoretical discussion and stick to actual pain points

## 2. Current Situation: Feature Areas
**Purpose**: Categorizes the historical problems into logical groupings that will be addressed.
**Content**: 4-5 feature areas, each with a title and brief description of which historical problems it addresses.
**Tips**:
- Each feature area should address multiple related problems
- Explicitly reference which problems from the historical context are being addressed
- Keep descriptions brief but clear about the connection

## 3. Implementation
**Purpose**: Outlines the specific solutions that will be built to address each feature area.
**Content**: For each feature area, list 3-5 concrete implementation items.
**Tips**:
- Be specific about what will actually be built
- Start each bullet with an action verb
- Ensure every feature area from section 2 has corresponding implementation items
- Keep items concise and focused on a single deliverable

## 4. Importance of the Changes
**Purpose**: Explains how each implementation directly solves the historical problems.
**Content**: For each feature area's implementation, explain:
- Which specific historical problem it addresses
- How the implementation solves that problem
- What benefit this creates
**Tips**:
- Begin each point by referencing the specific problem being solved
- Create a clear connection between the problem and solution
- Highlight the transformation that will occur

## 5. Future Impact
**Purpose**: Shows the transformative change from the current state to the future state.
**Content**: For each feature area, use "From X to Y" statements showing the transformation.
**Tips**:
- Start each bullet with "From [current state] to [future state]"
- Make the contrast between past and future clear
- Focus on the end-user experience transformation
- Be specific about what will improve

## 6. Key Questions for Interview - Identified Gaps
**Purpose**: Identifies information gaps that need to be addressed.
**Content**: For each feature area, list 3-5 specific questions that need answers.
**Tips**:
- Focus on technical and implementation details not yet clarified
- Phrase as direct questions
- Target information needed for successful implementation
- Organize by feature area

## How to Use This Structure
1. **Starting with Problems**: If you have a list of customer problems, organize them in the Historical Context section, then group them into feature areas and complete the remaining sections.

2. **Starting with a Test Plan**: If you have a test plan:
   - Extract the problems the test plan is attempting to solve and place them in Historical Context
   - Group test cases into logical feature areas for section 2
   - Convert test cases to implementation items for section 3
   - Complete the importance and future impact by connecting implementations back to problems

The key to success with this structure is maintaining clear connections between sections - each historical problem should be addressed by a feature area, which should have specific implementations, whose importance is explained by how they solve the original problems, leading to transformative impacts.
